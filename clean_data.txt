conception of this idea his autobiographical sketch ecce homo written in the autumn of 1888 contains the following passage the fundamental idea of my work namely the eternal recurrence of all things this highest of all possible formulas of a yeasaying philosophy first occurred to me in august 1 88 i made a note of the thought on a sheet of paper with the postscript 6000 feet beyond men and time [END]  [BEGIN] that day i happened to be wandering through the woods alongside of the lake of silvaplana and i halted beside a huge pyramidal and towering rock not far from surlei [END]  [BEGIN] it was then that the thought struck me [END]  [BEGIN] looking back now i find that exactly two months previous to this inspiration i had had an omen of its coming in the form of a sudden and decisive alteration in my tastes more particularly in music [END]  [BEGIN] it would even be possible to consider all zarathustra as a musical composition [END]  [BEGIN] at all events a very necessary condition in its production was a renaissance in myself of the art of hearing [END]  [BEGIN] in a small mountain resort recoaro near vicenza where i spent the spring of 1 88 1 1 and my friend and maestro peter cast also one who had been born again discovered that the phoenix music that hovered over us wore lighter and brighter plumes than it had done theretofore [END]  [BEGIN] introduction x during the month of august 1881 my brother resolved to reveal the teaching of the eternal recurrence in dithyrambic and psalmodic form through the mouth of zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] among the notes of this period we found a page on which is written the first definite plan of thus spake zarathustra midday and eternity [END]  [BEGIN] guideposts to a new way of living beneath this is written zarathustra born on lake urmi left his home in his thirtieth year went into the province of aria and during ten years of solitude in the mountains composed the zendavesta [END]  [BEGIN] the sun of knowledge stands once more at midday and the serpent of eternity lies coiled in its light it is your time ye midday brethren [END]  [BEGIN] in that summer of 1881 my brother after many years of steadily declining health began at last to rally and it is to this first gush of the recovery of his once splendid bodily condition that we owe not only the joyful wisdom which in its mood may be regarded as a prelude to zarathustra but also zara thustra itself [END]  [BEGIN] just as he was beginning to recuperate his health however an unkind destiny brought him a number of most painful personal experiences [END]  [BEGIN] his friends caused him many disappointments which were the more bitter to him in asmuch as he regarded friendship as such a sacred institution and for the first time in his life he realized the whole horror of that loneliness to which perhaps all greatness is con demned [END]  [BEGIN] but to be forsaken is something very different from deliberately choosing blessed loneliness [END]  [BEGIN] how he longed in those days for the ideal friend who would thoroughly under stand him to whom he would be able to say all and whom he imagined he had found at various periods in his life from his xvi introduction earliest youth onwards [END]  [BEGIN] now however that the way he had chosen grew ever more perilous and steep he found nobody who could follow him he therefore created a perfect friend for himself in the ideal form of a majestic philosopher and made this creation the preacher of his gospel to the world [END]  [BEGIN] whether my brother would ever have written thus spake zarathustra according to the first plan sketched in the sum mer of 1 88 1 if he had not had the disappointments already referred to is now an idle question but perhaps where zara thustra is concerned we may also say with master eckhardt the fleetest beast to bear you to perfection is suffering [END]  [BEGIN] my brother writes as follows about the origin of the first part of zarathustra in the winter of i was living on the charming little gulf of rapallo not far from genoa and between chiavari and cape porto fino [END]  [BEGIN] my health was not very good the winter was cold and exceptionally rainy and the small inn in which i lived was so close to the water that at night my sleep would be disturbed if the sea were high [END]  [BEGIN] these circumstances were surely the very reverse of favorable and yet in spite of it all and as if in demonstration of my belief that everything decisive comes to life in spite of every obstacle it was precisely during this winter and in the midst of these un favorable circumstances that my zarathustra originated [END]  [BEGIN] in the morning i used to start out in a southerly direction up the glorious road to zoagli which rises aloft through a forest of pines and gives one a view far out into the sea [END]  [BEGIN] in the after noon as often as my health permitted i walked round the whole bay from santa margherita to beyond porto fino [END]  [BEGIN] this spot was all the more interesting to me inasmuch as it was so dearly loved by the emperor frederick iii [END]  [BEGIN] in the autumn of 1886 i chanced to be there again when he was revisiting this small forgotten world of happiness for the last time [END]  [BEGIN] it was on introduction these two roads that all zarathustra came to me above all zarathustra himself as a type i ought rather to say that it was on these walks that these ideas waylaid me [END]  [BEGIN] the first part of zarathustra was written in about ten days that is to say from the beginning to about the middle of february the last lines were written precisely in the hallowed hour when richard wagner gave up the ghost in venice [END]  [BEGIN] with the exception of the ten days occupied in composing the first part of this book my brother often referred to this winter as the hardest and sickliest he had ever experienced [END]  [BEGIN] he did not however mean thereby that his former disorders were troubling him but that he was suffering from a severe attack of influenza which he had caught in santa margherita and which tormented him for several weeks after his arrival in genoa [END]  [BEGIN] as a matter of fact however what he complained of most was his spiritual condition that indescribable forsaken ness to which he gives such heartrending expression in zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] even the reception which the first part met with at the hands of friends and acquaintances was extremely disheartening for almost all those to whom he presented copies of the work misunderstood it [END]  [BEGIN] i found no one ripe for many of my thoughts the case of zarathustra proves that one can speak with the utmost clearness and yet not be heard by any one [END]  [BEGIN] my brother was very much discouraged by the feeble ness of the response he was given and as he was striving just then to give up the practice of taking hydrate of chloral a drug he had begun to take while ill with influenza the fol lowing spring spent in rome was a somewhat gloomy one for him [END]  [BEGIN] he writes about it as follows i spent a melancholy spring in rome where i only just managed to live and this was no easy matter [END]  [BEGIN] this city which is absolutely unsuited tq xvlli introduction the poetauthor of zarathustra and for the choice of which i was not responsible made me inordinately miserable [END]  [BEGIN] i tried to leave it [END]  [BEGIN] i wanted to go to aquila the opposite of rome in every respect and actually founded in a spirit of enmity to wards that city just as i also shall found a city some day as a memento of an atheist and genuine enemy of the church a person very closely related to me the great hohenstaufen the emperor frederick ii [END]  [BEGIN] but fate lay behind it all i had to return again to rome [END]  [BEGIN] in the end i was obliged to be satisfied with the piazza barberini after i had exerted myself in vain to find an antichristian quarter [END]  [BEGIN] i fear that on one occasion to avoid bad smells as much as possible i actually inquired at the palazzo del quirinale whether they could not provide a quiet room for a philosopher [END]  [BEGIN] in a chamber high above the piazza just mentioned from which one obtained a general view of rome and could hear the fountains plashing far below the loneliest of all songs was composed the nightsong [END]  [BEGIN] about this time i was obsessed by an unspeakably sad melody the refrain of which i recognised in the words dead through im mortality [END]  [BEGIN] we remained somewhat too long in rome that spring and what with the effect of the increasing heat and the discour aging circumstances already described my brother resolved not to write any more or in any case not to proceed with zara thustra although i offered to relieve him of all trouble in connection with the proofs and the publisher [END]  [BEGIN] when how ever we returned to switzerland towards the end of june and he found himself once more in the familiar and exhilarating air of the mountains all his joyous creative powers revived and in a note to me announcing the dispatch of some manuscript he wrote as follows i have engaged a place heie for three months forsooth i am the greatest fool to allow my courage to introduction xix be sapped from me by the climate of italy [END]  [BEGIN] now and again i am troubled by the thought what next [END]  [BEGIN] my future is the darkest thing in the world to me but as there still remains a great deal for me to do i suppose i ought rather to think of doing this than of my future and leave the rest to thee and the gods [END]  [BEGIN] the second part of zarathustra was written between the 26th of june and the 6th july [END]  [BEGIN] this summer finding myself once more in the sacred place where the first thought of zarathustra flashed across my mind i conceived the second part [END]  [BEGIN] ten days sufficed [END]  [BEGIN] neither for the second the first nor the third part have i required a day longer [END]  [BEGIN] he often used to speak of the ecstatic mood in which he wrote zarathustra how in his walks over hill and dale the ideas would crowd into his mind and how he would note them down hastily in a notebook from which he would tran scribe them on his return sometimes working till midnight [END]  [BEGIN] he says in a letter to me you can have no idea of the vehemence of such composition and in ecce homo autumn 1888 he describes as follows with passionate enthusiasm the incom parable mood in which he created zarathustra has any one at the end of the nineteenth century any distinct notion of what poets of a stronger age understood by the word inspiration [END]  [BEGIN] if not i will describe it [END]  [BEGIN] if one had the smallest vestige of superstition in one it would hardly be possible to set aside completely the idea that one is the mere incarnation mouthpiece or medium of an almighty power [END]  [BEGIN] the idea of revelation in the sense that something becomes sud denly visible and audible with indescribable certainty and accuracy which profoundly convulses and

with necessity un hesitatingly i have never had any choice in the matter [END]  [BEGIN] there is an ecstasy such that the immense strain of it is sometimes relaxed by a flood of tears along with which one s steps either rush or involuntarily lag alternately [END]  [BEGIN] there is the feeling that one is completely out of hand with the very distinct conscious ness of an endless number of fine thrills and quiverings to the very toes there is a depth of happiness in which the pain fullest and gloomiest do not operate as antitheses but as con ditioned as demanded in the sense of necessary shades of colour in such an overflow of light [END]  [BEGIN] there is an instinct for rhythmic relations which embraces wide areas of forms length the need of a wideembracing rhythm is almost the measure of the force of an inspiration a sort of counterpart to its pressure and tension [END]  [BEGIN] everything happens quite involun tarily as if in a tempestuous outburst of freedom of absolute ness of power and divinity [END]  [BEGIN] the involuntariness of the figures and similes is the most remarkable thing one loses all percep tion of what constitutes the figure and what constitutes the simile everything seems to present itself as the readiest the correctest and the simplest means of expression [END]  [BEGIN] it actually seems to use one of zarathustra s own phrases as if all things came unto one and would fain be similes here do all things come caressingly to thy talk and flatter thee for they want to ride upon thy back [END]  [BEGIN] on every simile dost thou here ride to every truth [END]  [BEGIN] here fly open unto thee all being s words and wordcabinets here all being wanteth to become words here all becoming wanteth to learn of thee how to talk [END]  [BEGIN] this is my

of 1883 my brother left the engadine for introduction xxi germany and stayed there a few weeks [END]  [BEGIN] in the following winter after wandering somewhat erratically through stresa genoa and spezia he landed in nice where the climate so happily promoted his creative powers that he wrote the third part of zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] in the winter beneath the halcyon sky of nice which then

period of preparation in about ten days [END]  [BEGIN] the composition of the fourth part alone was broken by occasional interruptions [END]  [BEGIN] the first notes relating to this part were written while he and i were staying together in zurich in september in the following november while staying at mentone he began to elaborate these notes and after a long pause finished the manuscript at nice

[END]  [BEGIN] the pitiful my friends there hath arisen a satire on your friend be hold zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] walketh he not amongst us as if amongst animals [END]  [BEGIN] but it is better said in this wise the discerning one walketh amongst men as amongst animals [END]  [BEGIN] man himself is to the discerning one the animal with red cheeks [END]  [BEGIN] how hath that happened unto him [END]  [BEGIN] is it not because he hath had to be ashamed too oft [END]  [BEGIN] o my friends [END]  [BEGIN] thus speaketh the discerning one shame shame shame that is the history of man [END]  [BEGIN] and on that account doth the noble one enjoin on him self not to abash bashfulness doth he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers [END]  [BEGIN] verily i like them not the merciful ones whose bliss is in their pity too destitute are they of bashfulness [END]  [BEGIN] if i must be pitiful i dislike to be called so and if i be so [END]  [BEGIN] it is preferably at a distance [END]  [BEGIN] 94 thus spake zarathustra preferably also do i shroud my head and flee before being recognised and thus do i bid you do my friends [END]  [BEGIN] may my destiny ever lead unafsicted ones like you across my path and those with whom i may have hope and repast and honey in common [END]  [BEGIN] verily i have done this and that for the afflicted but some thing better did i always seem to do when i had learned to enjoy myself better [END]  [BEGIN] since humanity came into being man hath enjoyed himself too little that alone my brethren is our original sin [END]  [BEGIN] and when we learn better to enjoy ourselves then do we unlearn best to give pain unto others and to contrive pain [END]  [BEGIN] therefore do i wash the hand that hach helped the sufferer therefore do i wipe also my soul [END]  [BEGIN] for in seeing the sufferer suffering thereof was i ashamed on account of his shame and in helping him sorely did i wound his pride [END]  [BEGIN] great obligations do not make grateful but revengeful and when a small kindness is not forgotten it becometh a gnawing worm [END]  [BEGIN] be shy in accepting [END]  [BEGIN] distinguish by accepting [END]  [BEGIN] thus do i advise those who have naught to bestow [END]  [BEGIN] i however am a bestower willingly do i bestow as friend to friends [END]  [BEGIN] strangers however and the poor may pluck for themselves the fruit from my tree thus doth it cause less shame [END]  [BEGIN] beggars however one should entirely do away with [END]  [BEGIN] verily it annoy eth one to give unto them and it annoy eth one not to give unto them [END]  [BEGIN] and likewise sinners and bad consciences [END]  [BEGIN] believe me my friends the sting of conscience teacheth one to sting [END]  [BEGIN] the pitiful 95 the worst things however are the petty thoughts [END]  [BEGIN] verily better to have done evilly than to have thought pettily [END]  [BEGIN] to be sure ye say the delight in petty evils spareth one many a great evil deed [END]  [BEGIN] but here one should not wish to be sparing [END]  [BEGIN] like a boil is the evil deed it itcheth and irritateth and breaketh forth it speaketh honourably [END]  [BEGIN] behold i am disease saith the evil deed that is its honourableness [END]  [BEGIN] but like infection is the petty thought it creepeth and hideth and wanteth to be nowhere until the whole body is decayed and withered by the petty infection [END]  [BEGIN] to him however who is possessed of a devil i would whisper this word in the ear better for thee to rear up thy devil [END]  [BEGIN] even for thee there is still a path to greatness [END]  [BEGIN] ah my brethren [END]  [BEGIN] one knoweth a little too much about every one [END]  [BEGIN] and many a one becometh transparent to us but still we can by no means penetrate him [END]  [BEGIN] it is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult [END]  [BEGIN] and not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair but to him who doth not concern us at all [END]  [BEGIN] if however thou hast a suffering friend then be a resting place for his suffering like a hard bed however a campbed thus wilt thou serve him best [END]  [BEGIN] and if a friend doeth thee wrong then say i forgive thee what thou hast done unto me that thou hast done it unto thyself however how could i forgive that [END]  [BEGIN] thus speaketh all great love it surpasseth even forgiveness and pity [END]  [BEGIN] one should hold fast one s heart for when one lecteth it go how quickly doth one s head run away [END]  [BEGIN] ah where in the world have th r been greater follies than 96 thus spake zarathustra with the pitiful [END]  [BEGIN] and what in the world hath caused more suffering than the follies of the pitiful [END]  [BEGIN] woe unto all loving ones who have not an elevation which is above their pity [END]  [BEGIN] thus spake the devil unto me once on a time even god hath his hell it is his love for man [END]  [BEGIN] and lately did i hear him say these words god is dead of his pity for man hath god died [END]  [BEGIN] so be ye warned against pity from thence there yet cometh unto men a heavy cloud [END]  [BEGIN] verily i understand weathersigns [END]  [BEGIN] but attend also to this word all great love is above all its pity for it seeketh to create what is loved [END]  [BEGIN] myself do i offer unto my love and my neighbour as my self such is the language of all creators [END]  [BEGIN] all creators however are hard [END]  [BEGIN] thus spake zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] the priests and one day zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spake these words unto them here are priests but although they are mine enemies pass them quietly and with sleeping swords [END]  [BEGIN] even among them there are heroes many of them have suffered too much so they want to make others suffer [END]  [BEGIN] bad enemies are they nothing is more revengeful than theii meekness [END]  [BEGIN] and readily doth he soil himself who toucheth them [END]  [BEGIN] the priests 97 but my blood is related to theirs and i want withal to see rny blood honoured in theirs [END]  [BEGIN] and when they had passed a pain attacked zarathustra but not long had he struggled with the pain when he began to speak thus it moveth my heart for those priests [END]  [BEGIN] they also go against my taste but that is the smallest matter unto me since i am among men [END]  [BEGIN] but i suffer ana have suffered with them prisoners are they unto me and stigmatised ones [END]  [BEGIN] he whom they call saviour put them in fetters in fetters of false values and fatuous words [END]  [BEGIN] oh that some one would save them from their saviour [END]  [BEGIN] on an isle they once thought they had landed when the sea tossed them about but behold it was a slumbering monster [END]  [BEGIN] false values and fatuous words these are the worst mon sters for mortals long slumbereth and waiteth the fate that is in them [END]  [BEGIN] but at last it cometh and awaketh and devoureth and en gulfeth whatever hath built tabernacles upon it [END]  [BEGIN] oh just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built themselves [END]  [BEGIN] churches they call their sweetsmelling caves [END]  [BEGIN] oh that falsified light that mustified air [END]  [BEGIN] where the soul may not fly aloft to its height [END]  [BEGIN] but so enjoineth their belief on your knees up the stair ye sinners [END]  [BEGIN] verily rather would i see a shameless one than the dis torted eyes of their shame and devotion [END]  [BEGIN] who created for themselves such caves and penitence stairs [END]  [BEGIN] was it not those who sought to conceal themselves and were ashamed under the clear sky [END]  [BEGIN] 98 thus spake zarathustra and only when the clear sky looketh again through ruined roofs and down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls will i again turn my heart to the seats of this god [END]  [BEGIN] they called god that which opposed and afflicted them and verily there was much herospirit in their worship [END]  [BEGIN] and they knew not how to love their god otherwise than by nailing men to the cross [END]  [BEGIN] as corpses they thought to live in black draped they their corpses even in their talk do i still feel the evil flavour of charnelhouses [END]  [BEGIN] and he who liveth nigh unto them liveth nigh unto black pools wherein the toad singeth his song with sweet gravity [END]  [BEGIN] better songs would they have to sing for me to believe in their saviour more like saved ones would his disciples have to appear unto me [END]  [BEGIN] naked would i like to see them for beauty alone should preach penitence [END]  [BEGIN] but whom would that disguised affliction convince [END]  [BEGIN] verily their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom s seventh heaven [END]  [BEGIN] verily they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge [END]  [BEGIN] of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist but into every defect had they put their illusion their stopgap which they called god [END]  [BEGIN] in their pity was their spirit drowned and when they swelled and o erswelled with pity there always floated to the surface a great folly [END]  [BEGIN] eagerly arid with shouts drove they their flock over their footbridge as if there were but one footbridge to the future [END]  [BEGIN] verily those shepherds also were still of the flock [END]  [BEGIN] small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds but thevirtuous 99 my brethren what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto been [END]  [BEGIN] characters of blood did they write on the way they went and their folly taught that truth is proved by blood [END]  [BEGIN] but blood is the very worst witness to truth blood tainteth the purest teaching and turneth it into delusion and hatred of heart [END]  [BEGIN] and when a person goeth through fire for his teaching what doth that prove [END]  [BEGIN] it is more verily when out of one s own burning cometh one s own teaching [END]  [BEGIN] sultry heart and cold head where these meet there ariseth the blusterer the saviour [END]  [BEGIN] greater ones verily have there been and higherborn ones than those whom the people call saviours those rapturous blusterers [END]  [BEGIN] and by still greater ones than any of the saviours must ye be saved my brethren if ye would find the way to freedom [END]  [BEGIN] never yet hath there been a superman [END]  [BEGIN] naked have i seen both of them the greatest man and the smallest man alltoosimilar are they still to each other [END]  [BEGIN] verily even the greatest found i alltoohuman [END]  [BEGIN] thus spake zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] the virtuous with thunder and heavenly fireworks must one speak to in dolent and somnolent senses [END]  [BEGIN] but beauty s voice speaketh gently it appealeth only to the most awakened souls [END]  [BEGIN] 100 thus spake zarathustra gently vibrated and laughed unto me today my buckler it was beauty s holy laughing and thrilling [END]  [BEGIN] at you ye virtuous ones laughed my beauty today [END]  [BEGIN] and thus came its voice unto me they want to be paid besides [END]  [BEGIN] ye want to be paid besides ye virtuous ones [END]  [BEGIN] ye want re ward for virtue and heaven for earth and eternity for your to day [END]  [BEGIN] and now ye upbraid me for teaching that there is no reward giver nor paymaster [END]  [BEGIN] and verily i do not even teach that virtue is its own reward [END]  [BEGIN] ah [END]  [BEGIN] this is my sorrow into the basis of things have reward and punishment been insinuated and now even into the basis of your souls ye virtuous ones [END]  [BEGIN] but like the snout of the boar shall my word grub up the basis of your souls a ploughshare will i be called by you [END]  [BEGIN] all the secrets of your heart shall be brought to light and when ye lie in the sun grubbed up and broken then will also your falsehood be separated from your truth [END]  [BEGIN] for this is your truth ye are too pure for the filth of the words vengeance punishment recompense retribution [END]  [BEGIN] ye love your virtue as a mother loveth her child but when did one hear of a mother wanting to be paid for her love [END]  [BEGIN] it is your dearest self your virtue [END]  [BEGIN] the ring s thirst is in you to reach itself again struggleth every ring and turneth itself [END]  [BEGIN] and like the star that goeth out so is every work of your virtue ever is its light on its way and travelling and when will it cease to be on its way [END]  [BEGIN] thus is the light of your virtue still on its way even when its work is done [END]  [BEGIN] be it forgotten and dead still its ray of light liveth and travelleth [END]  [BEGIN] that your virtue is your self and not an outward thing a the virtuous ioi skin or a cloak that is the truth from the basis of your souls ye virtuous ones [END]  [BEGIN] but sure enough there are those to whom virtue meaneth writhing under the lash and ye have hearkened too much unto their crying [END]  [BEGIN] and others are there who call virtue the slothfulness of their vices and when once their hatred and jealousy relax the limbs their justice becometh lively and rubbeth its sleepy eyes [END]  [BEGIN] and others are there who are drawn downwards their devils draw them [END]  [BEGIN] but the more they sink the more ardently gloweth their eye and the longing for their god [END]  [BEGIN] ah [END]  [BEGIN] their crying also hath reached your ears ye virtuous ones what i am not that that is god to me and virtue [END]  [BEGIN] and others are there who go along heavily and creakingly like carts taking stones downhill they talk much of dignity and virtue their drag they call virtue [END]  [BEGIN] and others are there who are like eightday clocks when wound up they tick and want people to call ticking virtue [END]  [BEGIN] verily in those have i mine amusement wherever i find such clocks i shall wind them up with my mockery and they shall even whirr thereby [END]  [BEGIN] and others are proud of their modicum of righteousness and for the sake of it do violence to all things so that the world is drowned in their unrighteousness [END]  [BEGIN] ah [END]  [BEGIN] how ineptly cometh the word virtue out of their mouth [END]  [BEGIN] and when they say i am just it always soundeth like i am just revenged [END]  [BEGIN] with their virtues they want to scratch out the eyes of their enemies and they elevate themselves only that they may lower others [END]  [BEGIN] and again there are those who sit in their swamp and speak io2 thus spake zarathustra thus from among the bulrushes virtue that is to sit quietly in the swamp [END]  [BEGIN] we bite no one and go out of the way of him who would bite and in all matters we have the opinion that is given us [END]  [BEGIN] and again there are those who love attitudes and think that virtue is a sort of attitude [END]  [BEGIN] their knees continually adore and their hands are eulogies of virtue but their heart knoweth naught thereof [END]  [BEGIN] and again there are those who regard it as virtue to say virtue is necessary but after all they believe only that police men are necessary [END]  [BEGIN] and many a one who cannot see men s loftiness calleth it virtue to see their baseness far too well thus calleth he his evil eye virtue [END]  [BEGIN] and some want to be edified and raised up and call it virtue and others want to be cast down and likewise call it virtue [END]  [BEGIN] and thus do almost all think that they participate in virtue and at least every one claimeth to be an authority on good and evil [END]  [BEGIN] but zarathustra came not to say unto all those liars and fools what do ye know of virtue [END]  [BEGIN] what could ye know of virtue [END]  [BEGIN] but that ye my friends might become weary of the old words which ye have learned from the fools and liars that ye might become weary of the words reward retri oution punishment righteous vengeance [END]  [BEGIN] that ye might become weary of saying that an action is good is because it is unselfish [END]  [BEGIN] ah [END]  [BEGIN] my friends [END]  [BEGIN] that your very self be in your action as the mother is in the child let that be your formula of virtue [END]  [BEGIN] the r ab ble 103 verily i have taken from you a hundred formulae and youi virtue s favourite playthings and now ye upbraid me as children upbraid [END]  [BEGIN] they played by the sea then came there a wave and swept their playthings into the deep and now do they cry [END]  [BEGIN] but the same wave shall bring them new playthings and spread before them new speckled shells [END]  [BEGIN] thus will they be comforted and like them shall ye also my friends have your comforting and new speckled shells [END]  [BEGIN] thus spake zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] s the rabble life is a well of delight but where the rabble also drink there all fountains are poisoned [END]  [BEGIN] to everything cleanly am i well disposed but i hate to see the grinning mouths and the thirst of the unclean [END]  [BEGIN] they cast their eye down into the fountain and now glanceth up to me their odious smile out of the fountain [END]  [BEGIN] the holy water have they poisoned with their lustfulness and when they called their filthy dreams delight then poisoned they also the words [END]  [BEGIN] indignant becometh the flame when they put their damp hearts to the fire the spirit itself bubbleth and smoketh when the rabble approach the fire [END]  [BEGIN] mawkish and

where there are graves are there resurrections [END]  [BEGIN] thus sang zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN]  [END]  [BEGIN] selfsurpassing will to truth do ye call it ye wisest ones that which im pelleth you and maketh you ardent [END]  [BEGIN] will for the thinkableness of all being thus do i call your will [END]  [BEGIN] all being would ye make thinkable for ye doubt with good reason whether it be already thinkable [END]  [BEGIN] but it shall accommodate and bend itself to you [END]  [BEGIN] so willetb selfsurpassing 12 3 your will [END]  [BEGIN] smooth shall it become and subject to the spirit as its mirror and reflection [END]  [BEGIN] that is your entire will ye wisest ones as a will to power and even when ye speak of good and evil and of estimates of value [END]  [BEGIN] ye would still create a world before which ye can bow the knee such is your ultimate hope and ecstasy [END]  [BEGIN] the ignorant to be sure the people they are like a river on which a boat floateth along and in the boat sit the estimates of value solemn and disguised [END]  [BEGIN] your will and your valuations have ye put on the river of becoming it betrayeth unto me an old will to power what is believed by the people as good and evil [END]  [BEGIN] it was ye ye wisest ones who put such guests in this boat and gave them pomp and proud names ye and your ruling will [END]  [BEGIN] onward the river now carrieth your boat it must carry it [END]  [BEGIN] a small matter if the rough wave f oameth and angrily resisteth its keel [END]  [BEGIN] it is not the river that is your danger and the end of your good and evil ye wisest ones but that will itself the will to power the unexhausted procreating lifewill [END]  [BEGIN] but that ye may understand my gospel of good and evil for that purpose will i tell you my gospel of life and of the nature of all living things [END]  [BEGIN] the living thing did i follow i walked in the broadest and narrowest paths to lea rn its nature [END]  [BEGIN] with a hundredfaced mirror did i catch its glance when its mouth was shut so that its eye might speak unto me [END]  [BEGIN] and its eye spake unto me [END]  [BEGIN] but wherever i found living things there heard i also the language of obedience [END]  [BEGIN] all living things are obeying things [END]  [BEGIN] 124 thus spake zarathustra and this heard i secondly whatever cannot obey itself is commanded [END]  [BEGIN] such is the nature of living things [END]  [BEGIN] this however is the third thing which i heard namely that commanding is more difficult than obeying [END]  [BEGIN] and not only because the commander beareth the burden of all obeyers and because this burden readily crusheth him an attempt and a risk seemed all commanding unto me and whenever it commandeth the living thing risketh itself there by [END]  [BEGIN] yea even when it commandeth itself then also must it atone for its commanding [END]  [BEGIN] of its own law must it become the judge and avenger and victim [END]  [BEGIN] how doth this happen [END]  [BEGIN] so did i ask myself [END]  [BEGIN] what persuadeth the living thing to obey and command and even be obedient in commanding [END]  [BEGIN] hearken now unto my word ye wisest ones [END]  [BEGIN] test it seri ously whether i have crept into the heart of life itself and into the roots of its heart [END]  [BEGIN] wherever i found a living thing there found i will to power and even in the will of the servant found i the will to be master [END]  [BEGIN] that to the stronger the weaker shall serve thereto per suadeth he his will who would be master over a still weaker one [END]  [BEGIN] that delight alone he is unwilling to forego [END]  [BEGIN] and as the lesser surrendereth himself to the greater that he may have delight and power over the least of all so doth even the greatest surrender himself and staketh life for the sake of power [END]  [BEGIN] it is the surrender of the greatest to run risk and danger and play dice for death [END]  [BEGIN] and where there is sacrifice and service and loveglances there also is the will to be master [END]  [BEGIN] by byways doth the weaker selfsurpassing 125 then slink into the fortress and into the heart of the mightier one and there stealeth power [END]  [BEGIN] and this secret spake life herself unto me [END]  [BEGIN] behold said she i am that which must ever surpass itself [END]  [BEGIN] to be sure ye call it will to procreation or impulse towards a goal towards the higher remoter more manifold but all that is one and the same secret [END]  [BEGIN] rather would i succumb than disown this one thing and verily where there is succumbing and leaffalling lo there doth life sacrifice itself for power [END]  [BEGIN] that i have to be struggle and becoming and purpose and crosspurpose ah he who divineth my will divineth well also on what crooked paths it hath to tread [END]  [BEGIN] whatever i create and however much i love it soon must i be adverse to it and to my love so willeth my will [END]  [BEGIN] and even thou discerning one art only a path and foot step of my will verily my will to power walketh even on the feet of thy will to truth [END]  [BEGIN] he certainly did not hit the truth who shot at it the formula will to existence that will doth not exist [END]  [BEGIN] for what is not cannot will that however which is in existence how could it still strive for existence [END]  [BEGIN] only where there is life is there also will not however will to life but so teach i thee will to power [END]  [BEGIN] much is reckoned higher than life itself by the living one but out of the very reckoning speaketh the will to power [END]  [BEGIN] thus did life once teach me and thereby ye wisest ones do i solve you the riddle of your hearts [END]  [BEGIN] verily i say unto you good and evil which would be ever lastingit doth not exist [END]  [BEGIN] of its own accord must it evet surpass itself anew [END]  [BEGIN] 126 thus spake zarathustra with your values and formulae of good and evil ye exercise power ye valuing ones and that is your secret love and the sparkling trembling and overflowing of your souls [END]  [BEGIN] but a stronger power groweth out of your values and a new surpassing by it breaketh egg and eggshell [END]  [BEGIN] and he who hath to be a creator in good and evil verily he hath first to be a destroyer and break values in pieces [END]  [BEGIN] thus doth the greatest evil pertain to the greatest good that however is the creating good [END]  [BEGIN] let us speak thereof ye wisest ones even though it be bad [END]  [BEGIN] to be silent is worse all suppressed truths become poisonous [END]  [BEGIN] and let everything break up which can break up by our truths [END]  [BEGIN] many a house is still to be built [END]  [BEGIN] thus spake zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN]  [END]  [BEGIN] the sublime ones calm is the bottom of my sea who would guess that it hideth droll monsters [END]  [BEGIN] unmoved is my depth but it sparkleth with swimming enigmas and laughters [END]  [BEGIN] a sublime one saw i today a solemn one a penitent of the spirit oh how my soul laughed at his ugliness [END]  [BEGIN] with upraised breast and like those who draw in their breath thus did he stand the sublime one and in silence o erhung with ugly truths the spoil of his hunting and rich in torn raiment many thorns also hung on him but i saw no rose [END]  [BEGIN] the sublime ones 127 not yet had he learned laughing and beauty [END]  [BEGIN] gloomy did this hunter return from the forest of knowledge [END]  [BEGIN] from the fight with wild beasts returned he home but even yet a wild beast gazeth out of his seriousness an unconquered wild beast [END]  [BEGIN] as a tiger doth he ever stand on the point of springing but i do not like those strained souls ungracious is my taste to wards all those self engrossed ones [END]  [BEGIN] and ye tell me friends that there is to be no dispute about taste and tasting [END]  [BEGIN] but all life is a dispute about taste and tasting [END]  [BEGIN] taste that is weight at the same time and scales and weigher and alas for every living thing that would live with out dispute about weight and scales and weigher [END]  [BEGIN] should he become weary of his sublimeness this sublime one then only will his beauty begin and then only will i taste him and find him savoury [END]  [BEGIN] and only when he turneth away from himself will he o erleap his own shadow and verily [END]  [BEGIN] into his sun [END]  [BEGIN] far too long did he sit in the shade the cheeks of the peni tent of the spirit became pale he almost starved on his expec tations [END]  [BEGIN] contempt is still in his eye and loathing hideth in his mouth [END]  [BEGIN] to be sure he now resteth but he hath not yet taken rest in the sunshine [END]  [BEGIN] as the ox ought he to do and his happiness should smell of the earth and not of contempt for the earth as a white ox would i like to see him which snorting and lowing walketh before the ploughshare and his lowing should also laud all that is earthly [END]  [BEGIN] dark is still his countenance the shadow of his hand danceth upon it [END]  [BEGIN] o ershadowed is still the sense of his eye [END]  [BEGIN] 128 thus spake zarathustra his deed itself is still the shadow upon him his doing obscureth the doer [END]  [BEGIN] not yet hath he overcome his deed [END]  [BEGIN] to be sure i love in him the shoulders of the ox but now do i want to see also the eye of the angel [END]  [BEGIN] also his hero will hath he still to unlearn an exalted one shall he be and not only a sublime one the ether itself should raise him the willless one [END]  [BEGIN] he hath subdued monsters he hath solved enigmas [END]  [BEGIN] but he should also redeem his monsters and enigmas into heavenly children should he transform them [END]  [BEGIN] as yet hath his knowledge not learned to smile and to be without jealousy as yet hath his gushing passion not become calm in beauty [END]  [BEGIN] verily not in satiety shall his longing cease and disappear but in beauty [END]  [BEGIN] gracefulness belongeth to the munificence of the magnanimous [END]  [BEGIN] his arm across his head thus should the hero repose thus should he also surmount his repose [END]  [BEGIN] but precisely to the hero is beauty the hardest thing of all [END]  [BEGIN] unattainable is beauty by all ardent wills [END]  [BEGIN] a little more a little less precisely this is much here it is the most here [END]  [BEGIN] to stand with relaxed muscles and with unharnessed will that is the hardest for all of you ye sublime ones [END]  [BEGIN] when power becometh gracious and descendeth into the visible i call such condescension beauty [END]  [BEGIN] and from no one do i want beauty so much as from thee thou powerful one let thy goodness be thy last self conquest [END]  [BEGIN] all evil do i accredit to thee therefore do i desire of thee the good [END]  [BEGIN] verily [END]  [BEGIN] have often laughed at the weaklings who think themselves good because they have crippled paws [END]  [BEGIN] the land of culture 129 the virtue of the pillar shalt thou strive after more beauti ful doth it ever become and more graceful but internally harder and more sustaining the higher it riseth [END]  [BEGIN] yea thou sublime one one day shalt thou also be beautiful and hold up the mirror to thine own beauty [END]  [BEGIN] then will thy soul thrill with divine desires and there will be adoration even in thy vanity [END]  [BEGIN] for this is the secret of the soul when the hero hath aban doned it then only approacheth it in dreams the super hero [END]  [BEGIN] thus spake zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] the land of culture too far did i fiy into the future a horror seized upon me [END]  [BEGIN] and when i looked around me lo [END]  [BEGIN] there time was my sole contemporary [END]  [BEGIN] then did i fly backwards homewards and always faster [END]  [BEGIN] thus did i come unto you ye presentday men and into the land of culture [END]  [BEGIN] for the first time brought i an eye to see you and good de sire verily with longing in my heart did i come [END]  [BEGIN] but how did it turn out with me [END]  [BEGIN] although so alarmed i had yet to laugh [END]  [BEGIN] never did mine eye see anything so motley coloured [END]  [BEGIN] i laughed and laughed while my foot stil trembled and my heart as well [END]  [BEGIN] here forsooth is the home of all the paint pots said i [END]  [BEGIN] 130 thus spake zarathustra with fifty patches painted on faces and limbs so sat ye there to mine astonishment ye presentday men [END]  [BEGIN] and with fifty mirrors around you which flattered your play of colours and repeated it [END]  [BEGIN] verily ye could wear no better masks ye presentday men than your own faces [END]  [BEGIN] who could recognise you [END]  [BEGIN] written all over with the characters of the past and these characters also pencilled over with new characters thus have ye concealed yourselves well from all decipherers [END]  [BEGIN] and though one be a trier of the reins who still believeth that ye have reins [END]  [BEGIN] out of colours ye seem to be baked and out of glued scraps [END]  [BEGIN] all times and peoples gaze diverscoloured out of your veils all customs and beliefs speak diverscoloured out of your ges tures [END]  [BEGIN] he who would strip you of veils and wrappers and paints and gestures would just have enough left to scare the crows [END]  [BEGIN] verily i myself am the scared crow that once saw you naked and without paint and i flew away when the skeleton ogled at me [END]  [BEGIN] rather would i be a daylabourer in the netherworld and among the shades of the bygone [END]  [BEGIN] fatter and fuller than ye are forsooth the nether worldlings [END]  [BEGIN] this yea this is bitterness to my bowels that i can neither endure you naked nor clothed ye presentday men [END]  [BEGIN] all that is unhomelike in the future and whatever maketh strayed birds shiver is verily more homelike and familiar than your reality [END]  [BEGIN] for thus speak ye real are we wholly and without faith and superstition thus do ye plume yourselves alas [END]  [BEGIN] even without plumes [END]  [BEGIN] indeed how would ye be able to believe ye diverscoloured the land of culture 131 ones [END]  [BEGIN] ye who are pictures of all that hath ever been believed [END]  [BEGIN] perambulating refutations are ye of belief itself and a dis location of all thought [END]  [BEGIN] untrustworthy ones thus do i call you ye real ones [END]  [BEGIN] all periods prate against one another in your spirits and the dreams and pratings of all periods were even realer than your awakeness [END]  [BEGIN] unfruitful are ye therefore do ye lack belief [END]  [BEGIN] but he who had to create had always his presaging dreams and astral premonitions and believed in believing [END]  [BEGIN] halfopen doors are ye at which gravediggers wait [END]  [BEGIN] and this is your reality everything deserveth to perish [END]  [BEGIN] alas how ye stand there before me ye unfruitful ones how lean your ribs [END]  [BEGIN] and many of you surely have had knowledge thereof [END]  [BEGIN] many a one hath said there hath surely a god niched something from me secretly whilst i slept [END]  [BEGIN] verily enough to make a girl for himself therefrom [END]  [BEGIN] amazing is the poverty of my ribs [END]  [BEGIN] thus hath spoken many a presentday man [END]  [BEGIN] yea ye are laughable unto me ye presentday men [END]  [BEGIN] and especially when ye marvel at yourselves [END]  [BEGIN] and woe unto me if i could not laugh at your marvelling and had to swallow all that is repugnant in your platters [END]  [BEGIN] as it is however i will make lighter of you since i have to carry what is heavy and what matter if beetles and maybugs also alight on my load [END]  [BEGIN] verily it shall not on that account become heavier to me [END]  [BEGIN] ana not from you ye presentday men shall my grear weari ness arise [END]  [BEGIN] ah whither shall i now ascend with my longing [END]  [BEGIN] from all mountains do i look out for fatherlands and motherlands [END]  [BEGIN] 132 thus spakt zarathustra but a home have i found nowhere unsettled am i in all cities and decamping at all gates [END]  [BEGIN] alien to me and a mockery are the presentday men to whom of late my heart impelled me and exiled am i from fatherlands and motherlands [END]  [BEGIN] thus do i love only my children s land the undiscovered in the remotest sea for it do i bid my sails search and search [END]  [BEGIN] unto my children will i make amends for being the child of my fathers and unto all the future for this presentday [END]  [BEGIN] thus spake zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN]  [END]  [BEGIN] immaculate perception when yestereve the moon arose then did i fancy it about to bear a sun so broad and teeming did it lie on the horizon [END]  [BEGIN] but it was a liar with its pregnancy and sooner will i believe in the man in the moon than in the woman [END]  [BEGIN] to be sure little of a man is he also that timid night reveller [END]  [BEGIN] verily with a bad conscience doth he stalk over the roofs [END]  [BEGIN] for he is covetous and jealous the monk in the moon covetous of the earth and all the joys of lovers [END]  [BEGIN] nay i like him not that tomcat on the roofs [END]  [BEGIN] hateful unto me are all that slink around half closed windows [END]  [BEGIN] piously and silently doth he stalk along on the starcarpets but i like no lighttreading human feet on which not even a spur jingleth [END]  [BEGIN] every honest one s step speaketh the cat however steal eth immaculate perception 133 along over the ground [END]  [BEGIN] lo [END]  [BEGIN] catlike doth the moon come along and dishonestly [END]  [BEGIN] this parable speak i unto you sentimental dissemblers unto you the pure discerners [END]  [BEGIN] you do call covetous ones [END]  [BEGIN] also ye love the earth and the earthly i have divined you well [END]  [BEGIN] but shame is in your love and a bad conscience ye are like the moon [END]  [BEGIN] to despise the earthly hath your spirit been persuaded but not your bowels these however are the strongest in you [END]  [BEGIN] and now is your spirit ashamed to be at the service of your bowels and goeth in byways and lying ways to escape its own shame [END]  [BEGIN] that would be the highest thing for me so saith your lying spirit unto itself to gaze upon life without desire and not like the dog with hangingout tongue to be happy in gazing with dead will free from the grip and greed of selfishness cold and ashygrey all over but with intoxicated mooneyes [END]  [BEGIN] that would be the dearest thing to me thus doth the se duced one seduce himself to love the earth as the moon loveth it and with the eye only to feel its beauty [END]  [BEGIN] and this do i call immaculate perception of all things to want nothing else from them but to be allowed to lie before them as a mirror with a hundred facets [END]  [BEGIN] oh ye sentimental dissemblers ye covetous ones [END]  [BEGIN] ye lack innocence in your desire and now do ye defame desiring on that account [END]  [BEGIN] verily not as creators as procreators or as jubilators do ye love the earth [END]  [BEGIN] where is innocence [END]  [BEGIN] where there is will to procreation [END]  [BEGIN] and he who seeketh to create beyond himself hath for me the purest will [END]  [BEGIN] 134 thus spake zarathustra where is beauty [END]  [BEGIN] where i must will with my whole will where i will love and perish that an image may not remain merely an image [END]  [BEGIN] loving and perishing these have rhymed from eternity [END]  [BEGIN] will to love that is to be ready also for death [END]  [BEGIN] thus do i speak unto you cowards [END]  [BEGIN] but now doth your emasculated ogling profess to be con templation [END]  [BEGIN] and that which can be examined with cowardly eyes is to be christened beautiful [END]  [BEGIN] oh ye violators of noble names [END]  [BEGIN] but it shall be your curse ye immaculate ones ye pure dis cerners that ye shall never bring forth even though ye lie broad and teeming on the horizon [END]  [BEGIN] verily ye fill your mouth with noble words and we are to believe that your heart overflowed ye cozeners [END]  [BEGIN] but my words are poor contemptible stammering words gladly do i pick up what falleth from the table at your repasts [END]  [BEGIN] yet still can i say therewith the truth to dissemblers [END]  [BEGIN] yea my fishbones shells and prickly leaves shall tickle the noses of dissemblers [END]  [BEGIN] bad air is always about you and your repasts your lascivious thoughts your lies and secrets are indeed in the air [END]  [BEGIN] dare only to believe in yourselves in yourselves and in your inward parts [END]  [BEGIN] he who doth not believe in himself always lieth [END]  [BEGIN] a god s mask have ye hung in front of you ye pure ones into a god s mask hath your execrable coiling snake crawled [END]  [BEGIN] verily ye deceive ye contemplative ones [END]  [BEGIN] even zarathus tra was once the dupe of your godlike exterior he did not divine the serpent s coil with which it was stuffed [END]  [BEGIN] a god s soul i once thought i saw playing in your games scholars 135 ye pure discerners [END]  [BEGIN] no better arts did i once dream of than your arts [END]  [BEGIN] serpents filth and evil odour the distance concealed from me and that a lizard s craft prowled thereabouts lasciviously [END]  [BEGIN] but i came nigh unto you then came to me the day and now cometh it to you at an end is the moon s love affair [END]  [BEGIN] see there [END]  [BEGIN] surprised and pale doth it stand before the rosy dawn [END]  [BEGIN] for already she cometh the glowing one her love to the earth cometh [END]  [BEGIN] innocence and creative desire is all solar love [END]  [BEGIN] see there how she cometh impatiently over the sea [END]  [BEGIN] do ye not feel the thirst and the hot breath of her love [END]  [BEGIN] at the sea would she suck and drink its depths to her height now riseth the desire of the sea with its thousand breasts [END]  [BEGIN] kissed and sucked would it be by the thirst of the sun vapour would it become and height and path of light and light itself [END]  [BEGIN] verily like the sun do i love life and all deep seas [END]  [BEGIN] and this meaneth to me knowledge all that is deep shall ascend to my height [END]  [BEGIN] thus spake zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] scholars when i lay asleep then did a sheep eat at the ivywreath on my head it ate and said thereby zarathustra is no longer a scholar [END]  [BEGIN] it said this and vert away clumsily and proudly [END]  [BEGIN] a chile [END]  [BEGIN] told it to int [END]  [BEGIN] 136 thus spake zarathustra i like to lie here where the children play beside the ruiaed wall among thistles and red poppies [END]  [BEGIN] a scholar am i still to the children and also to the thistles [END]  [BEGIN] ind red poppies [END]  [BEGIN] innocent are they even in their wickedness [END]  [BEGIN] but to the sheep i am no longer a scholar so willeth my lot blessings upon it [END]  [BEGIN] for this is the truth i have departed from the house of the scholars and the door have i also slammed behind me [END]  [BEGIN] too long did my soul sit hungry at their table not like them have i got the knack of investigating as the knack of nut cracking [END]  [BEGIN] freedom do i love and the air over fresh soil rather would i sleep on oxskins than on their honours and dignities [END]  [BEGIN] i am too hot and scorched with mine own thought often is it ready to take away my breath [END]  [BEGIN] then have i to go into the open air and away from all dusty rooms [END]  [BEGIN] but they sit cool in the cool shade they want in everything o be merely spectators and they avoid sitting where the sun burneth on the steps [END]  [BEGIN] like those who stand in the street and gape at the passersby thus do they also wait and gape at the thoughts which others have thought [END]  [BEGIN] should one lay hold of them then do they raise a dust like floursacks and involuntarily but who would divine that their dust came from corn and from the yellow delight of the sum mer fields [END]  [BEGIN] when they give themselves out as wise then do their petty sayings and truths chill me in their wisdom there is often an odour as if it came from the swamp ana verily i have eveiv heard the frog croak in it [END]  [BEGIN] clever are they they have dexterous fingers what aom my scholars 137 simplicity pretend to beside their multiplicity [END]  [BEGIN] all threading and knitting and weaving do their fingers understand thus do they make the hose of the spirit [END]  [BEGIN] good clockworks are they only be careful to wind them up properly [END]  [BEGIN] then do they indicate the hour without mistake and make a modest noise thereby [END]  [BEGIN] like millstones do they work and like pestles throw only seedcorn unto them [END]  [BEGIN] they know well how to grind corn small and make white dust out of it [END]  [BEGIN] they keep a sharp eye on one another and do not trust each other the best [END]  [BEGIN] ingenious in little artifices they wait for those whose knowledge walketh on lame feet like spiders do they wait [END]  [BEGIN] i saw them always prepare their poison with precaution and always did they put glass gloves on their fingers in doing so [END]  [BEGIN] they also know how to play with false dice and so eagerly did i find them playing that they perspired thereby [END]  [BEGIN] we are alien to each other and their virtues are even more repugnant to my taste than their falsehoods and false dice [END]  [BEGIN] and when i lived with them then did i live above them [END]  [BEGIN] therefore did they take a dislike to me [END]  [BEGIN] they want to hear nothing of any one walking above their heads and so they put wood and earth and rubbish betwixt me and their heads [END]  [BEGIN] thus did they deafen the sound of my tread and least have i hitherto been heard by the most learned [END]  [BEGIN] all mankind s faults and weaknesses did they put betwixt themselves and me they call it false ceiling in their houses [END]  [BEGIN] but nevertheless i walk with my thoughts above their heads 138 thus spake zarathustra and even should i walk on mine own errors still would i be above them and their heads [END]  [BEGIN] for men are not equal so speaketh justice [END]  [BEGIN] and what i will they may not will [END]  [BEGIN] thus spake zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN]  [END]  [BEGIN] poets m since i have known the body better said zarathustra tc one of his disciples the spirit hath only been to me sym bolically spirit and all the imperishable that is also but a simile [END]  [BEGIN] so have i heard thee say once before answered the dis ciple and then thou addedst but the poets lie too much [END]  [BEGIN] why didst thou say that the poets lie too much [END]  [BEGIN] why [END]  [BEGIN] said zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] thou askest why [END]  [BEGIN] i do not belong to those who may be asked after their why [END]  [BEGIN] is my experience but of yesterday [END]  [BEGIN] it is long ago that i ex perienced the reasons for mine opinions [END]  [BEGIN] should i not have to be a cask of memory if i also wanted to have my reasons with me [END]  [BEGIN] it is already too much for me even to retain mine opinions and many a bird flieth away [END]  [BEGIN] and sometimes also do i find a fugitive creature in my dovecote which is alien to me and trembleth when i lay my hand upon it [END]  [BEGIN] but what did zarathustra once say unto thee [END]  [BEGIN] that the poets lie too much [END]  [BEGIN] but zarathustra also is a poet [END]  [BEGIN] poets 139 believest thou that he there spake the truth [END]  [BEGIN] why dost thou believe it [END]  [BEGIN] the disciple answered i believe in zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] but zarathustra shook his head and smiled [END]  [BEGIN] belief doth not sanctify me said he leas of all the beliet in myself [END]  [BEGIN] but granting that some one did say in all seriousness that the poets lie too much he was right we do lie too much [END]  [BEGIN] we also know too little and are bad learners so we are obliged to lie [END]  [BEGIN] and which of us poets hath not adulterated his wine [END]  [BEGIN] many a poisonous hotchpotch hath evolved in our cellars many an indescribable thing hath there been done [END]  [BEGIN] and because we know little therefore are we pleased from the heart with the poor in spirit especially when they are young women [END]  [BEGIN] and even of those things are we desirous which old women tell one another in the evening [END]  [BEGIN] this do we call the eternally feminine in us [END]  [BEGIN] and as if there were a special secret access to knowledge which choketh up for those who learn anything so do we believe in the people and in their wisdom [END]  [BEGIN] this however do all poets believe that whoever pricketh up his ears when lying in the grass or on lonely slopes learneth something of the things that are betwixt heaven and earth [END]  [BEGIN] and if there come unto them tender emotions then do the poets always think that nature herself is in love with them and that she stealeth to their ear to whisper secrets into it and amorous flatteries of this do they plume and pride them selves before all mortals [END]  [BEGIN] ah f here are so many things betwixt heaven and earth of which only the poets have dreamed [END]  [BEGIN] 140 thus spake zarathustra and especially above the heavens for all gods are poet symbolisations poetsophistications [END]  [BEGIN] verily ever are we drawn aloft that is to the realm of the clouds on thse do we set our gaudy puppets and then call them gods and supermen are not they light enough for those chairs [END]  [BEGIN] all these gods and supermen [END]  [BEGIN] ah how i am weary of all the inadequate that is insisted on as actual [END]  [BEGIN] ah how i am weary of the poets [END]  [BEGIN] when zarathustra so spake his disciple resented it but was silent [END]  [BEGIN] and zarathustra also was silent and his eye directed itself inwardly as if it gazed into the far distance [END]  [BEGIN] at last he sighed and drew breath [END]  [BEGIN] i am of today and heretofore said he thereupon but some thing is in me that is of the morrow and the day following and the hereafter [END]  [BEGIN] i became weary of the poets of the old and of the new superficial are they all unto me and shallow seas [END]  [BEGIN] they did not think sufficiently into the depth therefore their feeling did not reach to the bottom [END]  [BEGIN] some sensation of voluptuousness and some sensation of tedium these have as yet been their best contemplation [END]  [BEGIN] ghostbreathing and ghostwhisking seemeth to me all the jingle jangling of their harps what have the 7 known hitherto of the fervour of tones [END]

[END]  [BEGIN] penitents of the spirit have i seen appearing they grew out of the poets [END]  [BEGIN] thus spake zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] thus spake zarathustra great events there is an isle in the sea not far from the happy isles of zarathustra on which a volcano ever smoketh of which isle the people and especially the old women amongst them say that it is placed as a rock before the gate of the nether world but that through the volcano itself the narrow way leadeth downwards which conducteth to this gate [END]  [BEGIN] now about the time that zarathustra sojourned on the happy isles it happened that a ship anchored at the isle on which standeth the smoking mountain and the crew went ishore to shoot rabbits [END]  [BEGIN] about the noontide hour however [END]  [BEGIN] when the captain and his men were together again they saw suddenly a man coming towards them through the air and a voice said distinctly it is time [END]  [BEGIN] it is the highest time [END]  [BEGIN] but when the figure was nearest to them it flew past quickly how ever like a shadow in the direction of the volcano then did they recognise with the greatest surprise that it was zarathus tra for they had all seen him before except the captain himself and they loved him as the people love in such wise that love and awe were combined in equal degree [END]  [BEGIN] behold [END]  [BEGIN] said the old helmsman there goeth zarathustra to hell [END]  [BEGIN] about the same time that these sailors landed on the fire isle there was a rumour that zarathustra had disappeared and when his friends were asked about it they said that he had gone on board a ship by night without saying whither he was going [END]  [BEGIN] thus there arose some uneasiness [END]  [BEGIN] after three days how ever there came the story of the ship s crew in addition to this great events 143 uneasiness and then did ail the people say that the devil had taken zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] his disciples laughed sure enough at this talk and one of them said even sooner would i believe that zarathustra hath taken the devil [END]  [BEGIN] but at the bottom of their hearts they were all full of anxiety and longing so their joy was great when on the fifth day zarathustra appeared amongst them [END]  [BEGIN] and this is the account of zarathustra s interview with the firedog the earth said he hath a skin and this skin hath diseases [END]  [BEGIN] one of these diseases for example is called man [END]  [BEGIN] and another of these diseases is called the firedog con cerning him men have greatly deceived themselves and let themselves be deceived [END]  [BEGIN] to fathom this mystery did i go o er the sea and i have seen the truth naked verily [END]  [BEGIN] barefooted up to the neck [END]  [BEGIN] now do i know how it is concerning the firedog and likewise concerning all the spouting and subversive devils of which not only old women are afraid [END]  [BEGIN] up with thee firedog out of thy depth [END]  [BEGIN] cried i and confess how deep that depth is [END]  [BEGIN] whence cometh that which thou snortest up [END]  [BEGIN] thou drinkest copiously at the sea that doth thine embit tered eloquence betray [END]  [BEGIN] in sooth for a dog of the depth thou takest thy nourishment too much from the surface [END]  [BEGIN] at the most i regard thee as the ventriloquist of the earth and ever when 1 have heard subversive and spouting devils speak i have found them like thee embittered mendacious and shallow [END]  [BEGIN] ye understand how to roar and obscure with ashes [END]  [BEGIN] ye are trie best braggarts and have sufficiently learned the art of makir.g dregs boil [END]  [BEGIN] 144 thus spake zarathustra where ye are there must always be dregs at hand and much that is spongy hollow and compressed it wanteth to have freedom [END]  [BEGIN] freedom ye all roar most eagerly but i have unlearned the belief in great events when there is much roaring and smoke about them [END]  [BEGIN] and

[BEGIN] in the mud of your contempt lay the statue but it is just its law that out of contempt its life and living beauty grow again [END]  [BEGIN] with diviner features doth it now arise seducing by its suffering and verily [END]  [BEGIN] it will yet thank you for o erthrowing it ye subverters [END]  [BEGIN] this counsel however do i counsel to kings and churches and to all that is weak with age or virtue let yourselves be o erthrown [END]  [BEGIN] that ye may again come to life and that virtue may come to you [END]  [BEGIN] thus spake i before the firedog then did he interrupt me sullenly and asked church [END]  [BEGIN] what is that [END]  [BEGIN] church [END]  [BEGIN] answered i that is a kind of state and indeed the most mendacious [END]  [BEGIN] but remain quiet thou dissembling dog [END]  [BEGIN] thou surely knowest thine own species best [END]  [BEGIN] like thyself the state is a dissembling dog like rnee doth great events 145 it like to speak with smoke and roaring to make believe like thee that it speaketh out of the heart of things [END]  [BEGIN] for it seeketh by all means to be the most important crea ture on earth the state and people think it so [END]  [BEGIN] when i had said this the firedog acted as if mad with envy [END]  [BEGIN] what [END]  [BEGIN] cried he the most important creature on earth [END]  [BEGIN] and people think it so [END]  [BEGIN] and so much vapour and terrible voices came out of his throat that i thought he would choke with vexation and envy [END]  [BEGIN] at last he became calmer and his panting subsided as soon however as he was quiet i said laughingly thou art angry firedog so i am in the right about thee and that i may also maintain the right hear the story of another firedog he speaketh actually out of theheart of the earth [END]  [BEGIN] gold doth his breath exhale and golden rain so doth his heart desire [END]  [BEGIN] what are ashes and smoke ind hot dregs to him [END]  [BEGIN] laughter flitteth from him like a variegated cloud adverse is he to thy gargling and spewing and grips in the bowels [END]  [BEGIN] the gold however and the laughter these doth he take out of the heart of the earth for that thou mayst know it the heart of the earth is of gold [END]  [BEGIN] when the firedog heard this he could no longer endure to listen to me [END]  [BEGIN] abashed did he draw in his tail said bowwow [END]  [BEGIN] in a cowed voice and crept down into his cave [END]  [BEGIN] thus told zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] his disciples however hardly listened to him so great was their eagerness to tell him about the sailors the rabbits and the flying man [END]  [BEGIN] what am i to think of it [END]  [BEGIN] said zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] am i indeed a ghost [END]  [BEGIN] but it may have been my shadow [END]  [BEGIN] ye have surely heard some thing of the wanderer and his shadow [END]  [BEGIN] 146 thus spake zarathustra one thing however is certain i must keep a tighter hold of it otherwise it will spoil my reputation [END]  [BEGIN] and once more zarathustra shook his head and wondered [END]  [BEGIN] what am i to think of it [END]  [BEGIN] said he once more [END]  [BEGIN] why did the ghost cry it is time [END]  [BEGIN] it is the highest time [END]  [BEGIN] for what is it then the highest time [END]  [BEGIN] ihus spake zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] the soothsayer and i saw a great sadness come over mankind [END]  [BEGIN] the best turned weary of their works [END]  [BEGIN] a doctrine appeared a faith ran beside it all is empty all is alike all hath been [END]  [BEGIN] and from all hills there reechoed all is empty all is alike all hath been [END]  [BEGIN] to be sure we have harvested but why have all our fruits become rotten and brown [END]  [BEGIN] what was it fell last night from the evil moon [END]  [BEGIN] in vain was all our labour poison hath our wine become the evil eye hath singed yellow our fields and hearts [END]  [BEGIN] arid have we all become and fire falling upon us

depth will not swallow [END]  [BEGIN] alas [END]  [BEGIN] where is there still a sea in which one could be drowned [END]  [BEGIN] so soundetb our plaint across shallow swamps [END]  [BEGIN] the soothsayer 147 verily even for dying have we become too weary now do we keep awake and live on in sepulchres [END]  [BEGIN] thus did zarathustra hear a soothsayer speak and the ore boding touched his heart and transformed him [END]  [BEGIN] sorrowfully did he go about and wearily and he became like unto those of whom the soothsayer had spoken [END]  [BEGIN] verily said he unto his disciples a little while and there cometh the long twilight [END]  [BEGIN] alas how shall i preserve my light through it [END]  [BEGIN] that it may not smother in this sorrowfulness [END]  [BEGIN] to remoter worlds shall it be a light and also to remotest nights [END]  [BEGIN] thus did zarathustra go about grieved in his heart and for three days he did not take any meat or drink he had no rest and lost his speech [END]  [BEGIN] at last it came to pass that he fell into a deep sleep [END]  [BEGIN] his disciples however sat around him in long nightwatches and waited anxiously to see if he would awake and speak again and recover from his affliction [END]  [BEGIN] and this is the discourse that zarathustra spake when he awoke his voice however came unto his disciples as from afar hear i pray you the dream that i dreamed my friends and help me to divine its meaning [END]  [BEGIN] a riddle is it still unto me this dream the meaning is hidden in it and encaged and doth not yet fly above it on free pinions [END]  [BEGIN] all life had i renounced so i dreamed [END]  [BEGIN] nightwatchman and graveguardian had i become aloft in the lone mountain fortress of death [END]  [BEGIN] there did i guard his coffins full stood the musty vaults of those trophies of victory [END]  [BEGIN] out of glass coffins did vanquished life gaze upon me [END]  [BEGIN] the odour of dustcovered eternities did i breathe sultry 148 thus spake zarathustra and dustcovered lay my soul [END]  [BEGIN] and who could have aired his soul there [END]  [BEGIN] brightness of midnight was ever around me lonesomeness cowered beside her and as a third deathrattle stillness the worst of my female friends [END]  [BEGIN] keys did i carry the nastiest of all keys and i knew how to open with them the most creaking of all gates [END]  [BEGIN] like a bitterly angry croaking ran the sound through the long corridors when the leaves of the gate opened ungra ciously did this bird cry unwillingly was it awakened [END]  [BEGIN] but more frightful even and more heartstrangling was it when it again became silent and still all around and i alone sat in that malignant silence [END]  [BEGIN] thus did time pass with me and slip by if time there still was what do i know thereof [END]  [BEGIN] but at last there happened that which awoke me [END]  [BEGIN] thrice did there peal peals at the gate like thunders thrice did the vaults resound and howl again then did i go to the gate [END]  [BEGIN] alpa [END]  [BEGIN] cried i who carrieth his ashes unto the mountain [END]  [BEGIN] alpa [END]  [BEGIN] alpa [END]  [BEGIN] who carrieth his ashes unto the mountain [END]  [BEGIN] and i pressed the key and pulled at the gate and exerted myself [END]  [BEGIN] but not a finger sbreadth was it yet open then did a roaring wind tear the folds apart whistling whizzing and piercing it threw unto me a black coffin [END]  [BEGIN] and in the roaring and whistling and whizzing the cofiin burst open and spouted out a thousand peals of laughter [END]  [BEGIN] and a thousand caricatures of children angels owls fools and childsized butterflies laughed and mocked and roared at me fearfully was i terrified thereby it prostrated me [END]  [BEGIN] and i cried with horror as i ne er cried before [END]  [BEGIN] the soothsayer 149 but mine own crying awoke me and i came to myself [END]  [BEGIN] thus did zarathustra relate his dream and then was silent for as yet he knew not the interpretation thereof [END]  [BEGIN] but the dis ciple whom he loved most arose quickly seized zarathustra s hand and said thy life itself interpreted [END]  [BEGIN] unto us this dream g zara thustra [END]  [BEGIN] art thou not thyself the wind with shrill whistling which bursteth open the gates of the fortress of death [END]  [BEGIN] art thou not thyself the coffin full of manyhued malices and angelcaricatures of life [END]  [BEGIN] verily like a thousand peals of children s laughter cometh zarathustra into all sepulchres laughing at those nightwatch men and graveguardians and whoever else rattleth with sinis ter keys [END]  [BEGIN] with thy laughter wilt thou frighten and prostrate them fainting and recovering wilt thou demonstrate thy power over them [END]  [BEGIN] and when the long twilight cometh and the mortal weari ness even then wilt thou not disappear from our firmament thou advocate of life [END]  [BEGIN] new stars hast thou made us see and new nocturnal glories verily laughter itself hast thou spread out over us like a many hued canopy [END]  [BEGIN] now will children s laughter ever from coffins flow now will a strong wind ever come victoriously unto all mortal weari ness of this thou art thyself the pledge and the prophet [END]  [BEGIN] verily they themselves didst thou dream thine enemies that was thy sorest dream [END]  [BEGIN] but as thou awokest from them and earnest to thyself so shall they awaken from themselves and come unto thee [END]  [BEGIN] thus spake the disciple and all the others then thronged 150 thus spake zarathustra around zarathustra grasped him by the hands and tried to persuade him to leave his bed and his sadness and return unto them [END]  [BEGIN] zarathustra however sat upright on his couch with an absent look [END]  [BEGIN] like one returning from long foreign sojourn did he look on his disciples and examined their features but still he knew them not [END]  [BEGIN] when however they raised him and set him upon his feet behold all on a sudden his eye changed he understood everything that had happened stroked his beard and said with a strong voice well [END]  [BEGIN] this hath just its time but see to it my disciples that we have a good repast and without delay [END]  [BEGIN] thus do i mean to make amends for bad dreams [END]  [BEGIN] the soothsayer however shall eat and drink at my side and verily i will yet show him a sea in which ntr can drown himself [END]  [BEGIN] thus spake zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] then did he gaze long into the face of the disciple who had been the dreaminterpreter and shook his head [END]  [BEGIN]  [END]  [BEGIN] redemption when zarathustra went one day over the great bridge then did the cripples and beggars surround him and a hunchback spake thus unto him behold zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] even the people learn from thee and acquire faith in thy teaching but for them to believe fully in thee one thing is still needful thou must first of all convince us cripples [END]  [BEGIN] here hast thou now a fine selection and verily an redemption opportunity with more than one forelock [END]  [BEGIN] the blind canst thou heal and make the lame run and from him who hath too much behind couldst thou well also take away a little that i think would be the right method to make the cripples believe in zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] zarathustra however answered thus unto him who so spake when one taketh his hump from the hunchback then doth one take from him his spirit so do the people teach [END]  [BEGIN] and when one giveth the blind man eyes then doth he see too many bad things on the earth so that he curseth him who healed him [END]  [BEGIN] he however who maketh the lame man run in flicteth upon him the greatest injury for haidly can he run when his vices run away with him so do the people teach concerning cripples [END]  [BEGIN] and why should not zarathustra also learn from the people when the people learn from zara thustra [END]  [BEGIN] it is however the smallest thing unto me since i have been amongst men to see one person lacking an eye another an ear and a third a leg and that others have lost the tongue or the nose or the head [END]  [BEGIN] i see and have seen worse things and divers things so hideous that i should neither like to speak of all matteis nor even keep silent about some of them namely men who lack everything except that they have too much of one thing men who are nothing more than a big eye or a big mouth or a big belly or something else big reversed cripples i call such men [END]  [BEGIN] and when i came out of my solitude and for the first time passed over this bridge then i could not trust mine eyes but looked again and again and said at last that is an ear [END]  [BEGIN] an ear as big as a man [END]  [BEGIN] i looked still more attentively and ac 152 thus spake zarathustra tually there did move under the ear something that was pitiably small and poor and slim [END]  [BEGIN] and in truth this immense ear was perched on a small thin stalk the stalk however was a man [END]  [BEGIN] a person putting a glass to his eyes could even recognise fur ther a small envious countenance and also that a bloated soullet dangled at the stalk [END]  [BEGIN] the people told me however that the big ear was not only a man but a great man a genius [END]  [BEGIN] but i never believed in the people when they spake of great men and i hold to my belief that it was a reversed cripple who had too little of everything and too much of one thing [END]  [BEGIN] when zarathustra had spoken thus unto the hunchback and unto those of whom the hunchback was the mouthpiece and advocate then did he turn to his disciples in profound dejec tion and said verily my friends i walk amongst men as amongst the fragments and limbs of human beings [END]  [BEGIN] this is the terrible thing to mine eye that i find man broken up and scattered about as on a battle and butcher ground [END]  [BEGIN] and when mine eye fleeth from the present to the bygone it nndeth ever the same fragments and limbs and fearful chances but no men [END]  [BEGIN] the present and the bygone upon earth ah [END]  [BEGIN] my friends that is my most unbearable trouble and i should not know how to live if i were not a seer of .vhat is to come [END]  [BEGIN] a seer a purposer a creator a future itself and a bridge to the future and alas [END]  [BEGIN] also as it were a cripple on th s bridge all that is zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] and ye also asked yourselves often who is zarathustra to us [END]  [BEGIN] what shall he be called by us [END]  [BEGIN] and like me did re give yourselves questions for answers [END]  [BEGIN] is he a promiser [END]  [BEGIN] or a fulfiller [END]  [BEGIN] a conqueror [END]  [BEGIN] or an in redemption 153 heritor [END]  [BEGIN] a harvest [END]  [BEGIN] or a ploughshare [END]  [BEGIN] a physician [END]  [BEGIN] or a healed one [END]  [BEGIN] is he a poet [END]  [BEGIN] or a genuine one [END]  [BEGIN] an emancipator [END]  [BEGIN] or a sub jugator [END]  [BEGIN] a good one [END]  [BEGIN] or an evil one [END]  [BEGIN] i walk amongst men as the fragments of the future that future which i contemplate [END]  [BEGIN] and it is all my poetisation and aspiration to compose and collect into unity what is fragment and riddle and fearful chance [END]  [BEGIN] and hov could i endure to be a man if man were not also the composer and riddlereader and redeemer of chance [END]  [BEGIN] to redeem what is past and to transform every it was into thus would i have it [END]  [BEGIN] that only do i call redemption [END]  [BEGIN] will so is the emancipator and joybringer called thus have i taught you my friends [END]  [BEGIN] but now learn this likewise the will itself is still a prisoner [END]  [BEGIN] willing emancipateth but what is that called which still putteth the emancipator in chains [END]  [BEGIN] it was thus is the will s teethgnashing and lonesomest tribulation called [END]  [BEGIN] impotent towards what hath been done it is a malicious spectator of all that is past [END]  [BEGIN] not backward can the will will that it cannot break time and time s desire that is the will s lonesomest tribulation [END]  [BEGIN] willing emancipateth what doth willing itself devise in order to get free from its tribulation and mock at its prison [END]  [BEGIN] ah a fool becometh every prisoner [END]  [BEGIN] foolishly delivereth itself also the imprisoned will [END]  [BEGIN] that time dotli not run backward that is its animosity that which was so is the stone which it cannot roll called [END]  [BEGIN] and thus doth it roll stones out of animosity and illhumour and taketh revenge on whatever doth not like it feel rage and illhumour [END]  [BEGIN] 154 thus spake zarathustra thus did the will the emancipator become a torturer and on all that is capable of suffering it taketh revenge because it cannot go backward [END]  [BEGIN] this yea this alone is revenge itself the will s antipathy to time and its it was [END]  [BEGIN] verily a great folly dwelleth in our will and it became a curse unto all humanity that this folly acquired spirit [END]  [BEGIN] the spirit of revenge my friends that hath hitherto been man s best contemplation and where there was suffering it was claimed there was always penalty [END]  [BEGIN] penalty so calleth itself revenge [END]  [BEGIN] with a lying word it f eigneth a good conscience [END]  [BEGIN] and because in the wilier himself there is suffering because he cannot will backwards thus was willing itself and all life claimed to be penalty [END]  [BEGIN] and then did cloud after cloud roll over the spirit until at last madness preached everything perisheth therefore every thing deserveth to perish [END]  [BEGIN] and this itself is justice the law of time that he must devour his children thus did madness preach [END]  [BEGIN] morally are things ordered according to justice and penalty [END]  [BEGIN] oh where is there deliverance from the flux of things and from the existence of penalty [END]  [BEGIN] thus did madness preach [END]  [BEGIN] can there be deliverance when there is eternal justice [END]  [BEGIN] alas unreliable is the stone it was eternal must also be all penalties [END]  [BEGIN] thus did madness preach [END]  [BEGIN] no deed can be annihilated how could it be undone by the penalty [END]  [BEGIN] this this is what is eternal in the existence of penalty that existence also must be eternally recurring deed and guilt [END]  [BEGIN] unless the will should at last deliver itself and willing redemption 155 become non willing but ye know my brethren this fabu lous song of madness [END]  [BEGIN] away from those fabulous songs did i lead you when i taught you the will is a creator [END]  [BEGIN] all it was is a fragment a riddle a fearful chance until the creating will saith thereto but thus would i have it [END]  [BEGIN] until the creating will saith thereto but thus do i will it [END]  [BEGIN] thus shall i will it [END]  [BEGIN] but did it ever speak thus [END]  [BEGIN] and when doth this take place [END]  [BEGIN] hath the will been unharnessed from its own folly [END]  [BEGIN] hath the will become its own deliverer and joybringer [END]  [BEGIN] hath it unlearned the spirit of revenge and all teethgnashing [END]  [BEGIN] and who hath taught it reconciliation with time and some thing higher than all reconciliation [END]  [BEGIN] something higher than all reconciliation must the will will which is the will to power but how doth that take place [END]  [BEGIN] who hath taught it also to will backwards [END]  [BEGIN] but at this point in his discourse it chanced that zara thustra suddenly paused and looked like a person in the great est alarm [END]  [BEGIN] with terror in his eyes did he gaze on his disciples his glances pierced as with arrows their thoughts and arrear thoughts [END]  [BEGIN] but after a brief space he again laughed and said soothedly it is difficult to live amongst men because silence is so difficult especially for a babbler [END]  [BEGIN] thus spake zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] the hunchback however had listened to the conversation and had covered his face during the time but when he heard zarathustra laugh he looked up with curiosity and said slowly but why doth zarathustra speak otherwise unto us than unto his disciples [END]  [BEGIN] 156 thus spake zarathustra zarathustra answered what is there to be wondered at [END]  [BEGIN] with hunchbacks one may well speak in a hunchbacked way [END]  [BEGIN] very good said the hunchback and with pupils one may well tell tales out of school [END]  [BEGIN] but why doth zarathustra speak otherwise unto his pupils than unto himself [END]  [BEGIN]  [END]  [BEGIN] manly prudence not the height it is the declivity that is terrible [END]  [BEGIN] the declivity where the gaze shooteth downwards and the hand graspeth upwards [END]  [BEGIN] there doth the heart become giddy through its double will [END]  [BEGIN] ah friends do ye divine also my heart s double will [END]  [BEGIN] this this is my declivity and my danger that my gaze shooteth towards the summit and my hand would fain clutch and lean on the depth [END]  [BEGIN] to man clingeth my will with chains do i bind myself to man because i am pulled upwards to the superman for thither doth mine other will tend [END]  [BEGIN] and therefore do i live blindly among men as if i knew them not that my hand may not entirely lose belief in firmness [END]  [BEGIN] i know not you men this gloom and consolation is often spread around me [END]  [BEGIN] i sit at the gateway for every rogue and ask who wisheth to deceive me [END]  [BEGIN] this is my first manly prudence that i allow myself to be deceived so as not to be on my guard against deceivers [END]  [BEGIN] manly prudence 157 ah if i were on my guard against man how could man be an anchor to my ball [END]  [BEGIN] too easily would i be pulled upwards and away [END]  [BEGIN] this providence is over my fate that i have to be without foresight [END]  [BEGIN] and he who would not languish amongst men must learn to drink out of all glasses and he who would keep clean amongst men must know how to wash himself even with dirty water [END]  [BEGIN] and thus spake 1 often to myself for consolation courage [END]  [BEGIN] cheer up [END]  [BEGIN] old heart [END]  [BEGIN] an unhappiness hath failed to befall thee enjoy that as thy happiness [END]  [BEGIN] this however is mine other manly prudence i am more forbearing to the vain than to the proud [END]  [BEGIN] is not wounded vanity the mother of all tragedies [END]  [BEGIN] where however pride is wounded there there groweth up something better than pride [END]  [BEGIN] that life may be fair to behold its game mus f be well played for that purpose however it needeth good actors [END]  [BEGIN] good actors have i found all the vain ones they play and wish people to be fond of beholding them all their spirit is in this wish [END]  [BEGIN] they represent themselves they invent themselves in their neighbourhood i like to look upon life it cureth of mel ancholy [END]  [BEGIN] therefore am i forbearing to the vain because they are the physicians of my melancholy and keep me attached to man as to a drama [END]  [BEGIN] and further who conceiveth the full depth of the modesty of the vain man [END]  [BEGIN] i am favourable to him and sympathetic on account of his modesty [END]  [BEGIN] 158 thus spake zarathustra from you would he learn his belief in himself he feedeth upon your glances he eateth praise out of your hands [END]  [BEGIN] your lies doth he even believe when you lie favourably about him for in its depths sigheth his heart what am 7 [END]  [BEGIN] and if that be the true virtue which is unconscious of itself well the vain man is unconscious of his modesty [END]  [BEGIN] this is however my third manly prudence i am not put out of conceit with the wicked by your timorousness [END]  [BEGIN] i am happy to see the marvels the warm sun hatcheth tigers and palms and rattlesnakes [END]  [BEGIN] also amongst men there is a beautiful brood of the warm sun and much that is marvellous in the wicked [END]  [BEGIN] in truth as your wisest did not seem to me so very wise so found i also human wickedness below the fame of it [END]  [BEGIN] and oft did i ask with a shake of the head why still rattle ye rattlesnakes [END]  [BEGIN] verily there is still a future even for evil [END]  [BEGIN] and the warmest south is still undiscovered by man [END]  [BEGIN] how many things are now called the worst wickedness which are only twelve feet broad and three months long [END]  [BEGIN] some day however will greater dragons come into the world [END]  [BEGIN] for that the superman may not lack his dragon the super dragon that is worthy of him there must still much warm sun glow on moist virgin forests [END]  [BEGIN] out of your wild cats must tigers have evolved and out of your poisontoads crocodiles for the good hunter shall have a good hunt [END]  [BEGIN] and verily ye good and just [END]  [BEGIN] in you there is much to be laughed at and especially your fear of what hath hitherto been called the devil [END]  [BEGIN] so alien are ye in your souls to what is great that to you the superman would be

zarathustra j the pitiful p [END]  [BEGIN] 102 gt [END]  [BEGIN] cr the honey sacrifice again passed moons and years over zarathustra s soul and he heeded it not his hair however became white [END]  [BEGIN] one day when he sat on a stone in front of his cave and gazed calmly into the distance one there gazeth out on the sea and away beyond sinuous abysses then went his animals thought fully round about him and at last set themselves in front of him [END]  [BEGIN] o zarathustra said they gazest thou out perhaps for thy happiness [END]  [BEGIN] of what account is my happiness [END]  [BEGIN] answered he i have long ceased to strive any more for happiness i strive for my work [END]  [BEGIN] o zarathustra said the animals once more that sayest thou as one who hath overmuch of good things [END]  [BEGIN] liest thou not in a skyblue lake of happiness [END]  [BEGIN] ye wags answered zarathustra and smiled how well did ye choose the simile [END]  [BEGIN] but ye know also that my happiness is heavy and not like a fluid wave of water it presseth me and will not leave me and is like molten pitch [END]  [BEGIN] then went his animals again thoughtfully around him and placed themselves once more in front of him [END]  [BEGIN] o zarathustra said they it is consequently for that reason that thou thy self always becometh yellower and darker although thy hair looketh white and flaxen [END]  [BEGIN] lo thou sittest in thy pitch [END]  [BEGIN] what do ye say mine animals [END]  [BEGIN] said zarathustra laughing verily i reviled when i spake of pitch [END]  [BEGIN] as it happeneth with 264

a useful folly [END]  [BEGIN] here aloft can i now speak freer than in front of mountaincaves and ancho rites domestic animals [END]  [BEGIN] what to sacrifice [END]  [BEGIN] i squander what is given

upon himself and his shadow all at once he startled and shrank back for he saw another shadow beside his own [END]  [BEGIN] and when he hastily looked around and stood up behold there stood the soothsayer beside him the same whom he had once given to eat and drink at his table the proclaimer of the great weariness who taught all is alike nothing is worth while the world is without meaning knowledge strangleth [END]  [BEGIN] but his face had changed since then and when zarathustra looked into his eyes his heart was startled once more so much evil announcement and ashygrey lightnings passed over that coun tenance [END]  [BEGIN] the soothsayer who had perceived what went on in zara thustra s soul wiped his face with his hand as if he would wipe out the impression the same did also zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] and 268 thus spake zarathustra when both of them had thus silently composed and strength ened themselves they gave each other the hand as a token that they wanted once more to recognise each other [END]  [BEGIN] welcome hither said zarathustra thou soothsayer of the great weariness not in vain shalt thou once have been my messmate and guest [END]  [BEGIN] eat and drink also with me today and forgive it that a cheerful old man sitteth with thee at table [END]  [BEGIN] a cheerful old man [END]  [BEGIN] answered the soothsayer shaking his head but whoever thou art or wouldst be o zarathustra thou hast been here aloft the longest time in a little while thy bark shall no longer rest on dry land [END]  [BEGIN] do 1 then rest on dry land [END]  [BEGIN] asked zarathustra laughing [END]  [BEGIN] the waves around thy mountain answered the soothsayer rise and rise the waves of great distress and affliction they will soon raise thy bark also and carry thee away [END]  [BEGIN] thereupon was zarathustra silent and wondered [END]  [BEGIN] dost thou still hear nothing [END]  [BEGIN] continued the soothsayer doth it not rush and roar out of the depth [END]  [BEGIN] zarathustra was silent once more and listened then heard he a long long cry which the abysses threw to one another and passed on for none of them wished to retain it so evil did it sound [END]  [BEGIN] thou ill announcer said zarathustra at last that is a cry of distress and the cry of a man it may come perhaps out of a black sea [END]  [BEGIN] but what doth human distress matter to me [END]  [BEGIN] my last sin which hath been reserved for me knowest thou what it is called [END]  [BEGIN] pity [END]  [BEGIN] answered the soothsayer from an overflowing heart and raised both his hands aloft o zarathustra i have come that i may seduce thee to thy last sin [END]  [BEGIN] and hardly had those words been uttered when there sounded the cry once more and longer and more alarming the cry of distress 269 than before also much nearer [END]  [BEGIN] hearest thou [END]  [BEGIN] hearest thou o zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] called out the soothsayer the cry concerneth tnee it calleth thee come come come it is time it is the highest time [END]  [BEGIN] zarathustra was silent thereupon confused and staggered at last he asked like one who hesitateth in himself and who is it that there calleth me [END]  [BEGIN] but thou knowest it certainly answered the soothsayer warmly why dost thou conceal thyself [END]  [BEGIN] it is the higher man that crieth for thee [END]  [BEGIN] the higher man [END]  [BEGIN] cried zarathustra horrorstricken what wanteth he [END]  [BEGIN] what wanteth he [END]  [BEGIN] the higher man [END]  [BEGIN] what wanteth he here [END]  [BEGIN] and his skin covered with perspiration [END]  [BEGIN] the soothsayer however did not heed zarathustra s alarm but listened and listened in the downward direction [END]  [BEGIN] when however it had been still there for a long while he looked behind and saw zarathustra standing trembling [END]  [BEGIN] o zarathustra he began with sorrowful voice thou dost not stand there like one whose happiness maketh him giddy thou wilt have to dance lest thou tumble down [END]  [BEGIN] but although thou shouldst dance before me and leap all thy sideleaps no one may say unto me behold here danceth the last joyous man [END]  [BEGIN] in vain would any one come to this height who sought him here caves would he find indeed and backcaves hiding places for hidden ones but not lucky mines nor treasure chambers nor new goldveins of happiness [END]  [BEGIN] happiness how indeed could one find happiness among such buriedalive and solitary ones [END]  [BEGIN] must i yet seek the last happiness on the happy isles and far away among forgotten seas [END]  [BEGIN] 270 thus spake zarathustra but all is alike nothing is worth while no seeking is of service there are no longer any happy isies [END]  [BEGIN]  [END]  [BEGIN] thus sighed the soothsayer with his last sigh however zarathustra again became serene and assured like one who hath come out of a deep chasm into the light [END]  [BEGIN] nay [END]  [BEGIN] nay [END]  [BEGIN] three times nay [END]  [BEGIN] exclaimed he with a strong voice and stroked his beard that do i know better [END]  [BEGIN] there are still happy isles [END]  [BEGIN] silence thereon thou sighing sorrowsack [END]  [BEGIN] cease to splash thereon thou raincloud of the forenoon [END]  [BEGIN] do i not already stand here wet with thy misery and drenched like a dog [END]  [BEGIN] now do i shake myself and run away from thee that i may again become dry thereat mayest thou not wonder [END]  [BEGIN] do i seem to thee discourteous [END]  [BEGIN] here however is my court [END]  [BEGIN] but as regards the higher man well [END]  [BEGIN] i shall seek him at once in those forests from thence came his cry [END]  [BEGIN] perhaps he is there hard beset by an evil beast [END]  [BEGIN] he is in my domain therein shall he receive no scath [END]  [BEGIN] and verily there are many evil beasts about me [END]  [BEGIN] with those words zarathustra turned around to depart [END]  [BEGIN] then said the soothsayer o zarathustra thou art a rogue [END]  [BEGIN] i know it well thou wouldst fain be rid of me [END]  [BEGIN] rather wouldst thou run into the forest and lay snares for evil beasts [END]  [BEGIN] but what good will it do thee [END]  [BEGIN] in the evening wilt thou have me again in thine own cave will i sit patient and heavy like a block and wait for thee [END]  [BEGIN] so be it [END]  [BEGIN] shouted back zarathustra as he went away and what is mine in my cave belongeth also unto thee [END]  [BEGIN] my guest [END]  [BEGIN] shouldst thou however find honey therein well [END]  [BEGIN] just lick it up thou growling bear and sweeten thy soul [END]  [BEGIN] for in the eve ning we want both to be in good spirits talk with the kings 271 in good spirits and joyful because this day hath come to an end [END]  [BEGIN] and thou thyself shalt dance to my lays as my dancing bear [END]  [BEGIN] thou dost not believe this [END]  [BEGIN] thou shakest thy head [END]  [BEGIN] well [END]  [BEGIN] cheer up old bear [END]  [BEGIN] but i also am a soothsayer [END]  [BEGIN] thus spake zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] talk with the kings ere zarathustra had been an hour on his way in the moun tains and forests he saw all at once a strange procession [END]  [BEGIN] right on the path which he was about to descend came two kings walking bedecked with crowns and purple girdles and varie gated like flamingoes they drove before them a laden ass [END]  [BEGIN] what do these kings want in my domain [END]  [BEGIN] said zarathustra in astonishment to his heart and hid himself hastily behind a thicket [END]  [BEGIN] when however the kings approached to him he said half aloud like one speaking only to himself strange [END]  [BEGIN] strange [END]  [BEGIN] how doth this harmonise [END]  [BEGIN] two kings do i see and only one ass [END]  [BEGIN] thereupon the two kings made a halt they smiled and looked towards the spot whence the voice proceeded and afterwards looked into each other s faces [END]  [BEGIN] such things do we also think among ourselves said the king on the right but we do not utter them [END]  [BEGIN] the king on the left however shrugged his shoulders and 272 thus spake zarathustra answered that may perhaps be a goatherd [END]  [BEGIN] or an anchorite who hath lived too long among rocks and trees [END]  [BEGIN] for no society at all spoileth also good manners [END]  [BEGIN] good manners [END]  [BEGIN] replied angrily and bitterly the other king what then do we run out of the way of [END]  [BEGIN] is it not good manners [END]  [BEGIN] our good society [END]  [BEGIN] better verily to live among anchorites and goatherds than with our gilded false overrouged populace though it call itself good society [END]  [BEGIN] though it call itself nobility [END]  [BEGIN] but there all is false and foul above all the blood thanks to old evil diseases and worse curers [END]  [BEGIN] the best and dearest to me at present is still a sound peasant coarse artful obstinate and enduring that is at present the noblest type [END]  [BEGIN] the peasant is at present the best and the peasant type should be master [END]  [BEGIN] but it is the kingdom of the populace i no longer allow anything to be imposed upon me [END]  [BEGIN] the populace however that meaneth hodgepodge [END]  [BEGIN] populacehodgepodge therein is everything mixed with everything saint and swindler gentleman and jew and every beast out of noah s ark [END]  [BEGIN] good manners [END]  [BEGIN] everything is false and foul with us [END]  [BEGIN] no one knoweth any longer how to reverence it is that precisely that we run away from [END]  [BEGIN] they are fulsome obtrusive dogs they gild palmleaves [END]  [BEGIN] this loathing choketh me that we kings ourselves have be come false draped and disguised with the old faded pomp of our ancestors showpieces for the stupidest the craftiest and whosoever at present trafficketh for power [END]  [BEGIN] we are not the first men and have nevertheless to stand for talk with the kings 273 them of this imposture have we at last become weary and disgusted [END]  [BEGIN] from the rabble have we gone out of the way from all those bawlers and scribeblowflies from the traderstench the ambi tionfidgeting the bad breath fie to live among the rabble fie to stand for the first men among the rabble [END]  [BEGIN] ah loathing [END]  [BEGIN] loathing [END]  [BEGIN] loathing [END]  [BEGIN] what doth it now matter about us kings [END]  [BEGIN] thine old sickness seizeth thee said here the king on the left thy loathing seizeth thee my poor brother [END]  [BEGIN] thou knowest however that some one heareth us [END]  [BEGIN] immediately thereupon zarathustra who had opened ears and eyes to this talk rose from his hidingplace advanced towards the kings and thus began he who hearkeneth unto you he who gladly hearkeneth unto you is called zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] i am zarathustra who once said what doth it now matter about kings [END]  [BEGIN] forgive me i rejoiced when ye said to each other what doth it matter about us kings [END]  [BEGIN] here however is my domain and jurisdiction what may ye be seeking in my domain [END]  [BEGIN] perhaps however ye have found on your way what seek namely the higher man [END]  [BEGIN] when the kings heard this they beat upon their breasts and said with one voice we are recognised [END]  [BEGIN] with the sword of thine utterance severest thou the thickest darkness of our hearts [END]  [BEGIN] thou hast discovered our distress for lo [END]  [BEGIN] we are on our way to find the higher man the man that is higher than we although we are kings [END]  [BEGIN] to him do we convey this ass [END]  [BEGIN] for the highest man shall also be the highest lord on earth [END]  [BEGIN] there is no sorer misfortune in all human destiny than when the mighty of the earth are not also the first men [END]  [BEGIN] then 274 thus spake zarathustra everything becometh false and distorted and monstrous [END]  [BEGIN] and when they are even the last men and more beast than man then riseth and riseth the populace in honour and at last saith even the populace virtue lo i alone am virtue [END]  [BEGIN] what have i just heard [END]  [BEGIN] answered zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] what wis dom in kings [END]  [BEGIN] i am enchanted and verily i have already promptings to make a rhyme thereon even if it should happen to be a rhyme not suited for every one s ears [END]  [BEGIN] i unlearned long ago to have consideration for long ears [END]  [BEGIN] well then [END]  [BEGIN] well now [END]  [BEGIN] here however it happened that the ass also found utter ance it said distinctly and with malevolence yea [END]  [BEGIN] twas once methinks year one of our blessed lord drunk without wine

caesar a beast and god hath turned jew [END]  [BEGIN] with those rhymes of zarathustra the kings were delighted the king on the right however said o zarathustra how well it was that we set out to see thee [END]  [BEGIN] for thine enemies showed us thy likeness in their mirror there lookedst thou with the grimace ot a devil and sneer ingly so that we were afraid of thee [END]  [BEGIN] but what good did it do [END]  [BEGIN] always didst thou prick us anew in heart and ear with thy sayings [END]  [BEGIN] then did we say at last what doth it matter how he look [END]  [BEGIN] talk with the kings 25 we must hear him him who teacheth ye shall love peace as a means to new wars and the short peace more than the long [END]  [BEGIN] no one ever spake such warlike words what is good [END]  [BEGIN] to be brave is good [END]  [BEGIN] it is the good war that halloweth every cause [END]  [BEGIN] o zarathustra our fathers blood stirred in our veins at such words it was like the voice of spring to old winecasks [END]  [BEGIN] when the swords ran among one another like redspotted serpents then did our fathers become fond of life the sun of every peace seemed to them languid and lukewarm the long peace however made them ashamed [END]  [BEGIN] how they sighed our fathers when they saw on the wall brightly furbished driedup swords [END]  [BEGIN] like those they thirsted for war [END]  [BEGIN] for a sword thirsteth to drink blood and sparkleth with desire [END]  [BEGIN] when the kings thus discoursed and talked eagerly of the happiness of their fathers there came upon zarathustra no little desire to mock at their eagerness for evidently they were very peaceable kings whom he saw before him kings with old and refined features [END]  [BEGIN] but he restrained himself [END]  [BEGIN] well [END]  [BEGIN] said he thither leadeth the way there lieth the cave of zara thustra and this day is to have a long evening [END]  [BEGIN] at present however a cry of distress calleth me hastily away from you [END]  [BEGIN] it will honour my cave if kings want to sit and wait in it but to be sure ye will have to wait long [END]  [BEGIN] well [END]  [BEGIN] what of that [END]  [BEGIN] where doth one at present learn better to wait than at courts [END]  [BEGIN] and the whole virtue of kings that hath remained unto them is it not called today ability to wait [END]  [BEGIN] thus spake zarathustra 2j6 thus spake zarathustra the leech and zarathustra went thoughtfully on further and lower down through forests and past moory bottoms as it hap peneth however to every one who meditateth upon hara matters he trod thereby unawares upon a man [END]  [BEGIN] and lo there spurted into his face all at once a cry of pain and two curses and twenty bad invectives so that in his fright he raised his stick and also struck the trodden one [END]  [BEGIN] immediately afterwards however he regained his composure and his heart laughed at the folly he had just committed [END]  [BEGIN] pardon me said he to the trodden one who had got up enraged and had seated himself pardon me and hear first of all a parable [END]  [BEGIN] as a wanderer who dreameth of remote things on a lone some highway runneth unawares against a sleeping dog a dog which lieth in the sun as both of them then start up and snap at each other like deadly enemies those two beings mortally frightened so did it happen unto us [END]  [BEGIN] and yet [END]  [BEGIN] and yet how little was lacking for them to caress each other that dog and that lonesome one [END]  [BEGIN] are they not both lonesome ones [END]  [BEGIN] whoever thou art said the trodden one still enraged thou treadest also too nigh me with thy parable and not only with thy foot [END]  [BEGIN] lo [END]  [BEGIN] am i then a dog [END]  [BEGIN] and thereupon the sitting one got up and pulled his naked arm out of the swamp [END]  [BEGIN] for at first he had jain outstretched on the ground hidden and indis cernible like those who lie in wait for swampgame [END]  [BEGIN] the leech 277 but whatever art thou about [END]  [BEGIN] called out zaathustra in alarm for he saw a deal of blood streaming over the naked arm what hath hurt thee [END]  [BEGIN] hath an evil beast bit thee thou unfortunate one [END]  [BEGIN] the bleeding one laughed still angry what matter is it to thee [END]  [BEGIN] said he and was about to go on [END]  [BEGIN] here am i at home and in my province [END]  [BEGIN] let him question me whoever will to a dolt however i shall hardly answer [END]  [BEGIN] thou art mistaken said zarathustra sympathetically and held him fast thou art mistaken [END]  [BEGIN] here thou art not at home but in my domain and therein shall no one receive any hurt [END]  [BEGIN] call me however what thou wilt i am who i must be [END]  [BEGIN] i call myself zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] well [END]  [BEGIN] up thither is the way to zarathustra s cave it is not far wilt thou not attend to thy wounds at my home [END]  [BEGIN] it hath gone badly with thee thou unfortunate one in this life first a beast bit thee and then a man trod upon thee [END]  [BEGIN] when however the trodden one had heard the name of zarathustra he was transformed [END]  [BEGIN] what happeneth unto me [END]  [BEGIN] he exclaimed who preoccupieth me so much in this life as this one man namely zarathustra and that one animal that liveth on blood the leech [END]  [BEGIN] for the sake of the leech did i lie here by this swamp like a fisher and already had mine outstretched arm been bitten ten times when there biteth a still finer leech at my blood zarathustra himself [END]  [BEGIN] o happiness [END]  [BEGIN] o miracle [END]  [BEGIN] praised be this day which enticed me into the swamp [END]  [BEGIN] praised be the best the livest cupping glass that at present liveth praised be the great conscience leech zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] 178 thus spake zarathustra thus spake the trodden one and zarathustra rejoiced at his words and their refined reverential style [END]  [BEGIN] who art thou [END]  [BEGIN] asked he and gave him his hand there is much to clear up and elucidate between us but already methinketh pure clear day is dawning [END]  [BEGIN] i am the spiritually conscientious one answered he who was asked and in matters of the spirit it is difficult for any one to take it more rigorously more restrictedly and more severely than i except him from whom i learnt it zarathustra himself [END]  [BEGIN] better know nothing than half know many things [END]  [BEGIN] better be a fool on one s own account than a sage on other people s approbation [END]  [BEGIN] i go to the basis what matter if it be great or small [END]  [BEGIN] if it be called swamp or sky [END]  [BEGIN] a handbreadth of basis is enough for me if it be actually basis and ground [END]  [BEGIN] a handbreadth of basis thereon can one stand [END]  [BEGIN] in the true knowingknowledge there is nothing great and nothing small [END]  [BEGIN] then thou art perhaps an expert on the leech [END]  [BEGIN] asked zarathustra and thou investigatest the leech to its ultimate basis thou conscientious one [END]  [BEGIN] o zarathustra answered the trodden one that would be something immense how could i presume to do so [END]  [BEGIN] that however of which i am master and knower is the brain of the leech that is my world [END]  [BEGIN] and it is also a world [END]  [BEGIN] forgive it however that my pride here findeth expression for here i have not mine equal [END]  [BEGIN] there fore said i here am i at home [END]  [BEGIN] how long have i investigated this one thing the brain of the leech so that here the slippery truth might no longer slip from me [END]  [BEGIN] here is my domain [END]  [BEGIN] for the sake of this did i cast everything else aside for the leech 279 the sake of this did everything else become indifferent to me and close beside my knowledge lieth my black ignorance [END]  [BEGIN] my spiritual conscience requireth from me that it should be so that i should know one thing and not know all else they are a loathing unto me all the semispiritual all the hazy hovering and visionary [END]  [BEGIN] where mine honesty ceaseth there am i blind and want also to be blind [END]  [BEGIN] where i want to know however there want i also to be honest namely severe rigorous restricted cruel and inexorable [END]  [BEGIN] because thou once saidest o zarathustra spirit is life which itself cutteth into life that led and allured me to thy doctrine [END]  [BEGIN] and verily with mine own blood have i in creased mine own knowledge [END]  [BEGIN] as the evidence indicateth broke in zarathustra for still was the blood flowing down on the naked arm of the conscientious one [END]  [BEGIN] for there had ten leeches bitten into it [END]  [BEGIN] o thou strange fellow how much doth this very evidence teach me namely thou thyself [END]  [BEGIN] and not all perhaps might i pour into thy rigorous ear [END]  [BEGIN] well then [END]  [BEGIN] we part here [END]  [BEGIN] but i would fain find thee again [END]  [BEGIN] up thither is the way to my cave tonight shalt thou there by my welcome guest [END]  [BEGIN] fain would i also make amends to thy body for zarathustra treading upon thee with his feet i think about that [END]  [BEGIN] just now however a cry of distress calleth me hastily away from thee thus spake zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] 280 thus spake zarathustra the magician when however zarathustra had gone round a rock then saw he on the same path not far below him a man who threw his limbs about like a maniac and at last tumbled to the ground on his belly [END]  [BEGIN] halt [END]  [BEGIN] said then zarathustra to his heart he there must surely be the higher man from him came that dreadful cry of distress i will see if i can help him [END]  [BEGIN] when however he ran to the spot where the man lay on the ground he found a trembling old man with fixed eyes and in spite of all zarathustra s efforts to lift him and

[END]  [BEGIN] who art thou at all [END]  [BEGIN] cried here the old magician with defiant voice who dareth to speak thus unto me the greatest man now living [END]  [BEGIN] and a green flash shot from his eye at zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] but immediately after he changed and said sadly o zarathustra i am weary of it i am disgusted with mine arts i am not great why do i dissemble [END]  [BEGIN] but thou knowest it well 1 sought for greatness [END]  [BEGIN] a great man i wanted to appear and persuaded many but the lie hath been beyond my power [END]  [BEGIN] on it do i collapse [END]  [BEGIN] o zarathustra everything is a lie in me but that i collapse this my collapsing is genuine [END]  [BEGIN] it honoureth thee said zarathustra gloomily looking down with sidelong glance it honoureth thee that thou soughtest for greatness but it betrayeth thee also [END]  [BEGIN] thou art not great [END]  [BEGIN] thou bad old magician that is the best and the honestest thing i honour in thee that thou

thou genuine [END]  [BEGIN] but tell me what seekest thou here in my forests and rocks [END]  [BEGIN] and if thou hast put thyself in my way what proof of me wouldst thou have [END]  [BEGIN] wherein didst thou put me to the test [END]  [BEGIN] thus spake zarathustra and his eyes sparkled [END]  [BEGIN] but the old magician kept silence for a while then said he did i put thee to the test [END]  [BEGIN] i seek only [END]  [BEGIN] o zarathustra i seek a genuine one a right one a simple the magician 287 one an unequivocal one a man of perfect honesty a vessel of wisdom a saint of knowledge a great man [END]  [BEGIN] knowest thou it not o zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] seek zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] and here there arose a long silence between them zara thustra however became profoundly absorbed in thought so that he shut his eyes [END]  [BEGIN] but afterwards coming back to the situa tion he grasped the hand of the magician and said full of politeness and policy well [END]  [BEGIN] up thither leadeth the way there is the cave of zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] in it mayest thou seek him whom thou wouldst fain find [END]  [BEGIN] and ask counsel of mine animals mine eagle and my se [END]  [BEGIN] pent they shall help thee to seek [END]  [BEGIN] my cave however is large [END]  [BEGIN] i myself to be sure i have as yet seen no great man [END]  [BEGIN] that which is great the acutest eye is at present insensible to it [END]  [BEGIN] it is the kingdom of the populace [END]  [BEGIN] many a one have i found who stretched and inflated him self and the people cried behold a

taught that to thee [END]  [BEGIN] is today the time for it [END]  [BEGIN] oh thou bad seeker why dost thou tempt me [END]  [BEGIN] thus spake zarathustra comforted in his heart and went laughing on his way [END]  [BEGIN] 288 thus spake zarathustra out of service not long however after zarathustra had freed hielf from the magician he again saw a person sitting beside the path which he followed namely a tall black man with a haggard pale countenance this man grieved him exceedingly [END]  [BEGIN] alas said he to his heart there sitteth disguised affliction me thinketh he is of the type of the priests what do they want in my domain [END]  [BEGIN] what [END]  [BEGIN] hardly have i escaped from that magician and must another necromancer again run across my path some sorcerer with layingonof hands some sombre wonderworker by the grace of god some anointed world maligner whom may the devil take [END]  [BEGIN] but the devil is never at the place which would be his right place he always cometh too late that cursed dwarf and club foot [END]  [BEGIN] thus cursed zarathustra impatiently in his heart and con sidered how with averted look he might slip past the black man [END]  [BEGIN] but behold it came about otherwise [END]  [BEGIN] for at the same moment had the sitting one already perceived him and not unlike one whom an unexpected happiness overtaketh he sprang to his feet and went straight towards zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] whoever thou art thou traveller said he help a strayed one a seeker an old man who may here easily come to grief [END]  [BEGIN] the world here is strange to me and remote wild beasts also did i hear howling and he who could have given me pro tection he is himself no more [END]  [BEGIN] i was seeking the last pious man a saint and an anchorite out of service 289 who alone in his forest had not yet heard d what all the world knoweth at present [END]  [BEGIN] what doth all the world know at present [END]  [BEGIN] asked zara thustra [END]  [BEGIN] perhaps that the old god no longer liveth in whom all the world once believed [END]  [BEGIN] thou sayest it answered the old man sorrowfully [END]  [BEGIN] and i served that old god until his last hour [END]  [BEGIN] now however am i out of service without master and yet not free likewise am i no longer merry even for an hour except it be in recollections [END]  [BEGIN] therefore did i ascend into these mountains that i might finally have a festival for myself once more as becometh an old pope and churchfather for know it that i am the last pope [END]  [BEGIN] a festival of pious recollections and divine services [END]  [BEGIN] now however is he himself dead the most pious of men the saint in the forest who praised his god constantly with singing and mumbling [END]  [BEGIN] he himself found i no longer when i found his cot but two wolves found i therein which howled on account of his death for all animals loved him [END]  [BEGIN] then did i haste away [END]  [BEGIN] had i thus come in vain into these forests and mountains [END]  [BEGIN] then did my heart determine that i should seek another the most pious of all those who believe not in god my heart determined that i should seek zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] thus spake the hoary man and gazed with keen eyes at him who stood before him [END]  [BEGIN] zarathustra however seized the hand of the old pope and regarded it a long while with admiration [END]  [BEGIN] lo [END]  [BEGIN] thou venerable one said he then what a fine and long hand [END]  [BEGIN] that is the hand of one who hath ever dispensed blessings [END]  [BEGIN] now however doth it hold fast him whom thou seekest me zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] 290 thus spake zarathustra it is i the ungodly zarathustra who saith who is un godlier than i that i may enjoy his teaching [END]  [BEGIN] thus spake zarathustra and penetrated with his glances the thoughts and arrearthoughts of the old pope [END]  [BEGIN] at last the latter began he who most loved and possessed him hath now also lost him most lo i myself am surely the most godless of us at present [END]  [BEGIN] but who could rejoice at that [END]  [BEGIN] thou servedst him to the last [END]  [BEGIN] asked zarathustra thoughtfully after a deep silence thou knowest how he died [END]  [BEGIN] is it true what they say that sympathy choked him that he saw how man hung on the cross and could not endure it that his love to man became his hell and at last his death [END]  [BEGIN] the old pope however did not answer but looked aside timidly with a painful and gloomy expression [END]  [BEGIN] let him go said zarathustra after prolonged meditation still looking the old man straight in the eye [END]  [BEGIN] let him go he is gone [END]  [BEGIN] and though it honoureth thee that thou speakest only in praise of this dead one yet thou knowest as well as i who he was and that he went curious ways [END]  [BEGIN] to speak before three eyes said the old pope cheerfully he was blind of one eye in divine matters i am more en lightened than zarathustra himself and may well be so [END]  [BEGIN] my love served him long years my will followed all his will [END]  [BEGIN] a good servant however knoweth everything and many a thing even which a master hideth from himself [END]  [BEGIN] he was a hidden god full of secrecy [END]  [BEGIN] verily he did not come by his son otherwise than by secret ways [END]  [BEGIN] at the door of his faith standeth adultery [END]  [BEGIN] whoever extolleth him as a god of love doth not think out of service 29 [END]  [BEGIN] highly enough of love itself [END]  [BEGIN] did not that god want also to be judge [END]  [BEGIN] but the loving one loveth irrespective of reward and requital [END]  [BEGIN] when he was young that god out of the orient then was he harsh and revengeful and built himself a hell for the delight of his favourites [END]  [BEGIN] at last however he became old and soft and mellow and pitiful more like a grandfather than a father but most like a tottering old grandmother [END]  [BEGIN] there did he sit shrivelled in his chimneycorner fretting on account of his weak legs worldweary willweary and one day he suffocated of his alltoogreat pity [END]  [BEGIN] thou old pope said here zarathustra interposing hast thou seen thai with thine eyes [END]  [BEGIN] it could well have happened in that way in that way and also otherwise [END]  [BEGIN] when gods die they always die many kinds of death [END]  [BEGIN] weil [END]  [BEGIN] at all events one way or other he is gone [END]  [BEGIN] he was counter to the taste of mine ears and eyes worse than that i should not like to say against him [END]  [BEGIN] i love everything that looketh bright and speaketh honestly [END]  [BEGIN] but he thou knowest it forsooth thou old priest there was something of thy type in him the priest type he was equivo cal [END]  [BEGIN] he was also indistinct [END]  [BEGIN] how he raged at us this wrath snorter because we understood him badly [END]  [BEGIN] but why did he not speak more clearly [END]  [BEGIN] and if the fault lay in our ears why did he give us ears that heard him badly [END]  [BEGIN] if there was dirt in our ears well [END]  [BEGIN] who put it in them [END]  [BEGIN] too much miscarried with him this potter who had not learned thoroughly [END]  [BEGIN] that he took revenge on his pots and 292 thus spake zarathustra creations however because they turned out badly that was a sin against good taste [END]  [BEGIN] there is also good taste in piety this at last said away with such a god [END]  [BEGIN] better to have no god better to set up destiny on one s own account better to be a fool better to be god oneself [END]  [BEGIN] what do i hear [END]  [BEGIN] said then the old pope with intent ears o zarathustra thou art more pious than thou believest with such an unbelief [END]  [BEGIN] some god in thee hath converted thee to thine ungodliness [END]  [BEGIN] is it not thy piety itself which no longer letteth thee be lieve in a god [END]  [BEGIN] and thine overgreat honesty will yet lead thee even beyond good and evil [END]  [BEGIN] behold what hath been reserved for thee [END]  [BEGIN] thou hast eyes and hands and mouth which have been predestined for bless ing from eternity [END]  [BEGIN] one doth not bless with the hand alone [END]  [BEGIN] nigh unto thee though thou professest to be the ungod liest one i feel a hale and holy odour of long benedictions i feel glad and grieved thereby [END]  [BEGIN] let me be thy guest o zarathustra for a single night [END]  [BEGIN] nowhere on earth shall i now feel better than with thee [END]  [BEGIN] amen [END]  [BEGIN] so shall it be [END]  [BEGIN] said zarathustra with great aston ishment up thither leadeth the way there lieth the cave of zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] gladly forsooth would i conduct thee thither myself thou venerable one for i love all pious men [END]  [BEGIN] but now a cry of dis tress calleth me hastily away from thee [END]  [BEGIN] in my domain shall no one come to grief my cave is a good haven [END]  [BEGIN] and best of all would i like to put every sorrowful one again on firm land and fin legs [END]  [BEGIN] the ugliest man 293 who however could take thy melancholy off thy shoulders [END]  [BEGIN] for that i am too weak [END]  [BEGIN] long verily should we have to wait until some one reawoke thy god for thee [END]  [BEGIN] for that old god liveth no more he is indeed dead [END]  [BEGIN] thus spake zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN]  [END]  [BEGIN] the ugliest man and again did zarathustra s feet run through mountains and forests and his eyes sought and sought but nowhere was he to be seen whom they wanted to see the sorely distressed sufferer and crier [END]  [BEGIN] on the whole way however he rejoiced in his heart and was full of gratitude [END]  [BEGIN] what good things said he hath this day given me as amends for its bad beginning [END]  [BEGIN] what strange interlocutors have i found [END]  [BEGIN] at their words will i now chew a long while as at good corn small shall my teeth grind and crush them until they flow like milk into my soul [END]  [BEGIN] when however the path again curved round a rock all at once the landscape changed and zarathustra entered into a realm of death [END]  [BEGIN] here bristled aloft black and red cliffs with out any grass tree or bird s voice [END]  [BEGIN] for it was a valley which all animals avoided even the beasts of prey except that a species of ugly thick green serpent came here to die when they be came old [END]  [BEGIN] therefore the shepherds called this valley serpent death [END]  [BEGIN] zarathustra however became absorbed in dark recollec tions for it seemed to him as if he had once before stood in 294 thus .pake zarathustra this valley [END]  [BEGIN] and much heaviness settled on his mind so that he walked slowly and always more slowly and at last stood still [END]  [BEGIN] then however when he opened his eyes he saw some thing sitting by the wayside shaped like a man and hardly like a man something nondescript [END]  [BEGIN] and all at once there came over zarathustra a great shame because he had gazed on such a thing [END]  [BEGIN] blushing up to the very roots of his white hair he turned aside his glance and raised his foot that he might leave this illstarred place [END]  [BEGIN] then however became the dead wilderness vocal for from the ground a noise welled up gurgling and rattling as water gurgleth and rartleth at night through stoppedup waterpipes and at last it turned into human voice and human speech it sounded thus zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] read my riddle [END]  [BEGIN] say say [END]  [BEGIN] what is the revenge on the witness [END]  [BEGIN] i entice thee back here is smooth ice [END]  [BEGIN] see to it see to it that thy pride does not here break its legs [END]  [BEGIN] thou thinkest thyself wise thou proud zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] read then the riddle thou hard nutcracker the riddle that i am [END]  [BEGIN] say then who am i [END]  [BEGIN] when however zarathustra had heard these words what think ye then took place in his soul [END]  [BEGIN] pity overcame him and he sank down all at once like an oak that hath long with stood many treefellers heavily suddenly to the terror even of those who meant to fell it [END]  [BEGIN] but immediately he got up again from the ground and his countenance became stern [END]  [BEGIN] i know thee well said he with a brazen voice thou art the murderer of god [END]  [BEGIN] let me go [END]  [BEGIN] thou couldst not endure him who beheld thee who ever beheld thee through and through thou ugliest man [END]  [BEGIN] thou tookest revenge on this witness [END]  [BEGIN] thus spake zarathustra and was about to go but the non the ugliest man 295 descript grasped at a corner of his garment and began anew to gurgle and seek for words [END]  [BEGIN] stay said he at last stay [END]  [BEGIN] do not pass by [END]  [BEGIN] i have divined what axe it was that struck thee to the ground hail to thee o zarathustra that thou art again upon thy feet [END]  [BEGIN] thou hast divined i know it well how the man f eeleth who killed him the murderer of god [END]  [BEGIN] stay [END]  [BEGIN] sit down here be side me it is not to no purpose [END]  [BEGIN] to whom would i go but unto thee [END]  [BEGIN] stay sit down [END]  [BEGIN] do not however look at me [END]  [BEGIN] honour thus mine ugliness [END]  [BEGIN] they persecute me now art thou my last refuge [END]  [BEGIN] not with their hatred not with their bailiffs oh such persecution would i mock at and be proud and cheerful [END]  [BEGIN] hath not all success hitherto been with the wellpersecuted ones [END]  [BEGIN] and he who persecuteth well learneth readily to be ob sequent when once he is put behind [END]  [BEGIN] but it is their pity their pity is it from which i flee away and flee to thee [END]  [BEGIN] o zarathustra protect me thou my last refuge thou sole one whodivinedstme thou hast divined how the mail f eeleth who killed him [END]  [BEGIN] stay [END]  [BEGIN] and if thou wilt go thou impatient one go not the way that i came [END]  [BEGIN] that way is bad [END]  [BEGIN] art thou angry with me because i have already racked lan guage too long [END]  [BEGIN] because i have already counselled thee [END]  [BEGIN] but know that it is i the ugliest man who have also the largest heaviest feet [END]  [BEGIN] where 7 have gone the way is bad [END]  [BEGIN] i tread all paths to death and destruction [END]  [BEGIN] but that thou passedst me by in silence that thou blushedst i saw it well thereby did i know thee as zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] every one else would have thrown to me his alms his pity in look and speech [END]  [BEGIN] but for that i am not beggar enough didst thou divine [END]  [BEGIN] 296 thus spake zarathustra for that i am too rich rich in what if fcreat frightful ugliest most unutterable [END]  [BEGIN] thy shame o zarathustra honoured me [END]  [BEGIN] with difficulty did i get out of the crowd of the pitiful that i might find the only one who at present teacheth that pity is obtrusive thyself o zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] whether it be the pity of a god or whether it be human pity it is offensive to modesty [END]  [BEGIN] and unwillingness to help may be nobler than the virtue that rusheth to do so [END]  [BEGIN] that however namely pity is called virtue itself at present by all petty people they have no reverence for great misfortune great ugliness great failure [END]  [BEGIN] beyond all these do i look as a dog looketh over the backs of thronging flocks of sheep [END]  [BEGIN] they are petty goodwooled goodwilled grey people [END]  [BEGIN] as the heron looketh contemptuously at shallow pools with backwardbent head so do i look at the throng of grey little waves and wills and souls [END]  [BEGIN] too long have we acknowledged them to be right those petty people so we have at last given them power as well and now do they teach that good is only wiiat petty people call good [END]  [BEGIN] and truth is at present what the preacher spake who him self sprang from them that singular saint and advocate of the petty people who testified of himself i am the truth [END]  [BEGIN] that immodest one hath long made the petty people greatly puffed up he who taught no small error when he taught i am the truth [END]  [BEGIN] hath an immodest one ever been answered more courte ously [END]  [BEGIN] thou however o zarathustra passedst him by and saidst nay [END]  [BEGIN] nay [END]  [BEGIN] three times nay [END]  [BEGIN] thou warnedst against his error thou warnedst the first the ugliest man 297 to do so against pity not every one not none but thyself and thy type [END]  [BEGIN] thou art ashamed of the shame of the great sufferer and verily when thou sayest from pity there cometh a heavy cloud take heed ye men [END]  [BEGIN] when thou teachest all creators are hard all great love is beyond their pity o zarathustra how well versed dost thou seem to me in weathersigns [END]  [BEGIN] thou thyself however warn thyself also against thy pity [END]  [BEGIN] for many are on their way to thee many suffering doubting despairing drowning freezing ones i warn thee also against myself [END]  [BEGIN] thou hast read my best my worst riddle myself and what i have done [END]  [BEGIN] i know the axe that felleth thee [END]  [BEGIN] but he had to die he looked with eyes which beheld everything he beheld men s depths and dregs all his hidden ignominy and ugliness [END]  [BEGIN] his pity knew no modesty he crept into my dirtiest corners [END]  [BEGIN] this most prying overintrusive overpitiful one had to die [END]  [BEGIN] he ever beheld me on such a witness i would have revenge or not live myself [END]  [BEGIN] the god who beheld everything and also man that god had to die [END]  [BEGIN] man cannot endure it that such a witness should live [END]  [BEGIN] thus spake the ugliest man [END]  [BEGIN] zarathustra however got up and prepared to go on for he felt frozen to the very bowels [END]  [BEGIN] thou nondescript said he thou warnedst me against thy path [END]  [BEGIN] as thanks for it i praise mine to thee [END]  [BEGIN] behold up thither is the cave of zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] my cave is large and deep and hath many corners there findeth he that is most hidden his hidingplace [END]  [BEGIN] and close be 298 thus spake zarathustra side k there are a hundred lurkingplaces and byplaces tor creeping fluttering and

surpassed [END]  [BEGIN] the voluntary beggar when zarathustra had left the ugliest man he was chilled and felt lonesome for much coldness and lonesomeness came over his spirit so that even his limbs became colder thereby [END]  [BEGIN] when however he wandered on and on uphill and down at times the voluntary beggar 299 past green meadows though also sometimes over wild stony couches where formerly perhaps an impatient brook had made its bed then he turned all at once warmer and heartier again [END]  [BEGIN] what hath happened unto me [END]  [BEGIN] he asked himself some thing warm and living quickeneth me it must be in the neigh bourhood [END]  [BEGIN] already am i less alone unconscious companions and brethren rove around me their warm breath toucheth my soul [END]  [BEGIN] when however he spied about and sought for the com forters of his lonesomeness behold there were kine there standing together on an eminence whose proximity and smell had warmed his heart [END]  [BEGIN] the kine however seemed to listen eagerly to a speaker and took no heed of him who approached [END]  [BEGIN] when however zarathustra was quite nigh unto them then did he hear plainly that a human voice spake in the midst of the kine and apparently all of them had turned their heads towards the speaker [END]  [BEGIN] then ran zarathustra up speedily and drove the animals aside for he feared that some one had here met with harm which the pity of the kine would hardly be able to relieve [END]  [BEGIN] but in this he was deceived for behold there sat a man on the ground who seemed to be persuading the animals to have no fear of him a peaceable man and preacheronthemount out of whose eyes kindness itself preached [END]  [BEGIN] what dost thou seek here [END]  [BEGIN] called out zarathustra in astonishment [END]  [BEGIN] what do i here seek [END]  [BEGIN] answered he the same that thou seekest thou mischiefmaker that is to say happiness upon earth [END]  [BEGIN] to that end however i would fain learn of these kine [END]  [BEGIN] for tell thee that i have already talked half a morning unto 30o thus spake zarathustra them and just now were they about to give me their answer [END]  [BEGIN] why dost thou disturb them [END]  [BEGIN] except we be converted and become as kine we shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven [END]  [BEGIN] for we ought to learn from them one thing ruminating [END]  [BEGIN] and verily although a man should gain the whole world and yet not learn one thing ruminating what would it profit him [END]  [BEGIN] he would not be rid of his

[BEGIN] thou also [END]  [BEGIN] but behold these kine [END]  [BEGIN] thus spake the preacheronthemount and turned then his own look towards zarathustra for hitherto it had rested lovingly on the kine then however he put on a different ex pression [END]  [BEGIN] who is this with whom i talk [END]  [BEGIN] he exclaimed frightened and sprang up from the ground [END]  [BEGIN] this is the man without disgust this is zarathustra him self the surmounter of the great disgust this is the eye this is the mouth this is the heart of zarathustra himself [END]  [BEGIN] and whilst he thus spake he kissed with o erflowing eyes the hands of him with whom he spake and behaved alto gether like one to whom a precious gift and jewel hath fallen unawares from heaven [END]  [BEGIN] the kine however gazed at it all and wondered [END]  [BEGIN] speak not of me thou strange one thou amiable one [END]  [BEGIN] said zarathustra and restrained his affection speak to me firstly of thyself [END]  [BEGIN] art thou not the voluntary beggar who once cast away great riches who was ashamed of his riches and of the rich and fled to the poorest to bestow upon them his abundance and his heart [END]  [BEGIN] but they received him not the voluntary beggar 301 but they received me not said the voluntary beggar thou knowest it forsooth [END]  [BEGIN] so i went at last to the animals and to those kine [END]  [BEGIN] then learnedst thou interrupted zarathustra how much harder it is to give properly than to take properly and that be stowing well is an art the last subtlest masterart of kind ness [END]  [BEGIN] especially nowadays answered the voluntary beggar at present that is to say when everything low hath become re bellious and exclusive and haughty in its manner in the manner of the populace [END]  [BEGIN] for the hour hath come thou knowest it forsooth for the great evil long slow mobandslaveinsurrection it extendeth and extendeth [END]  [BEGIN] now doth it provoke the lower classes all benevolence and petty giving and the overrich may be on their guard [END]  [BEGIN] whoever at present drip like bulgy bottles out of alltoo small necks of such bottles at present one willingly breaketh the necks [END]  [BEGIN] wanton avidity bilious envy careworn revenge populace pride all these struck mine eye [END]  [BEGIN] it is no longer true that the poor are blessed [END]  [BEGIN] the kingdom of heaven however is with the kine [END]  [BEGIN] and why is it not with the rich [END]  [BEGIN] asked zarathustra tempt ingly while he kept back the kine which sniff ed familiarly at the peaceful one [END]  [BEGIN] why dost thou tempt me [END]  [BEGIN] answered the other [END]  [BEGIN] thou knowest it thyself better even than i [END]  [BEGIN] what was it drove me to the poorest o zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] was it not my disgust at the richest [END]  [BEGIN] at the culprits of riches with cold eyes and rank thoughts thus spake zarathustra who pick up profit out of all kinds of rubbish at tins rabble that stinketh to heaven at this gilded falsified populace whose fathers were pickpockets or carrioncrows or ragpickers with wives com pliant lewd and forgetful for they are all of them not far different from harlots populace above populace below [END]  [BEGIN] what are poor and rich at present [END]  [BEGIN] that distinction did i unlearn then did i flee away further and ever further until i came to those kine [END]  [BEGIN] thus spake the peaceful one and puffed himself and per spired with his words so that the kine wondered anew [END]  [BEGIN] zara thustra however kept looking into his face with a smile all the time the man talked so severely and shook silently his head [END]  [BEGIN] thou doest violence to thyself thou preacheronthe mount when thou usest such severe words [END]  [BEGIN] for such severity neither thy mouth nor thine eye have been given thee [END]  [BEGIN] nor methinketh hath thy stomach either unto all such rage and hatred and foamingover is repugnant [END]  [BEGIN] thy stomach wanteth softer things thou art not a butcher [END]  [BEGIN] rather seemest thou to me a planteater and a rootman [END]  [BEGIN] perhaps thou grindest corn [END]  [BEGIN] certainly however thou art averse to fleshly joys and thou lovest honey [END]  [BEGIN] thou hast divined me well answered the voluntary beg gar with lightened heart [END]  [BEGIN] i love honey i also grind corn for i have sought out what tasteth sweetly and maketh pure breath also what recjuireth a long time a day s work and a mouth s work for gentle idlers and sluggards [END]  [BEGIN] furthest to be sure have those kine carried it they have de vised ruminating and lying in the sun [END]  [BEGIN] they also abstain from all heavy thoughts which inflate the heart [END]  [BEGIN] well [END]  [BEGIN] said zarathustra thou shouldst also see min the shadow 303 iiii cdgle and my serpent their like do not at present exist on earth [END]  [BEGIN] behold thither leadeth the way to my cave be tonight its guest [END]  [BEGIN] and talk to mine animals of the happiness of animals until i myself come home [END]  [BEGIN] for now a cry of distress calleth me hastily away from thee [END]  [BEGIN] also shouldst thou find new honey with me icecold goldencombhoney eat it [END]  [BEGIN] now however take leave at once of thy kine thou strange one [END]  [BEGIN] thou amiable one [END]  [BEGIN] though it be hard for thee [END]  [BEGIN] for they are thy warmest friends and preceptors [END]  [BEGIN] one excepted whom i hold still dearer answered the voluntary beggar [END]  [BEGIN] thou thyself art good o zarathustra and better even than a cow [END]  [BEGIN] away away with thee [END]  [BEGIN] thou evil flatterer [END]  [BEGIN] cried zarathus tra mischievously why dost thou spoil me with such praise and flatteryhoney [END]  [BEGIN] away away from me [END]  [BEGIN] cried he once more and heaved his stick at the fond beggar who however ran nimbly away [END]  [BEGIN] the shadow scarcely however was the voluntary beggar gone in haste and zarathustra again alone when he heard behind him a new voice which called out stay [END]  [BEGIN] zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] do wait [END]  [BEGIN] it if myself forsooth o zarathustra myself thy shadow [END]  [BEGIN] but zarathustra did not wait for a sudden irritation came over him on account of the crowd and the crowding in his moun tains [END]  [BEGIN] whither hath my lonesomeness gone [END]  [BEGIN] spake he [END]  [BEGIN] thus spake zarathustra it is verily becoming too much for me these mountains swarm my kingdom is no longer of this world i require new mountains [END]  [BEGIN] my shadow calleth me [END]  [BEGIN] what matter about my shadow [END]  [BEGIN] let it run after me [END]  [BEGIN] i run away from it [END]  [BEGIN] thus spake zarathustra to his heart and ran away [END]  [BEGIN] but the one behind followed after him so that immediately there were three runners one after the other namely foremost the voluntary beggar then zarathustra and thirdly and hindmost his shadow [END]  [BEGIN] but not long had they run thus when zarathustra became conscious of his folly and shook off with one jerk all his irritation and detestation [END]  [BEGIN] what [END]  [BEGIN] said he have not the most ludicrous things always happened to us old anchorites and saints [END]  [BEGIN] verily my folly hath grown big in the mountains [END]  [BEGIN] now do i hear six old fools legs rattling behind one another [END]  [BEGIN] but doth zarathustra need to be frightened by his shadow [END]  [BEGIN] also methinketh that after all it hath longer legs than mine [END]  [BEGIN] thus spake zarathustra and laughing with eyes and en trails he stood still and turned round quickly and behold he almost thereby threw his shadow and follower to the ground so closely had the latter followed at his heels and so weak was he [END]  [BEGIN] for when zarathustra scrutinised him with his glance he was frightened as by a sudden apparition so slender swarthy hollow and wornout did this follower appear [END]  [BEGIN] who art thou [END]  [BEGIN] asked zarathustra vehemently what doest thou here [END]  [BEGIN] and why callest thou thyself my shadow [END]  [BEGIN] thou art not pleasing unto me [END]  [BEGIN] forgive me answered the shadow that it is i and if i please thee not well o zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] therein do i admire thee and thy good taste [END]  [BEGIN] the shadow 305 a wanderer am i who have walked long at thy heels always on the way but without a goal also without a home so that verily i lack little of being the eternally wandering jew except that i am not eternal and not a jew what [END]  [BEGIN] must i ever be on the way [END]  [BEGIN] whirled by every wind unsettled driven about

nothing giveth i become thin i am almost equal to a shadow [END]  [BEGIN] after thee however o zarathustra did i fly and hie longest and though i hid myself from thee i was nevertheless thy best shadow wherever thou hast sat there sat i also [END]  [BEGIN] with thee have i wandered about in the remotest coldest worlds like a phantom that voluntarily haunteth winter roofs and snows [END]  [BEGIN] with thee have i pushed into all the forbidden all the worst and the furthest and if there be anything of virtue in me it is that i have had no fear of any prohibition [END]  [BEGIN] with thee have i broken up whatever my heart revered all boundarystones and statues have i o erthrown the most dan gerous wishes did i pursue verily beyond every crime did i once go [END]  [BEGIN] with thee did i unlearn the belief in words and worths and in great names [END]  [BEGIN] when the devil casteth his skin doth not his name also fall away [END]  [BEGIN] it is also skin [END]  [BEGIN] the devil himself is perhaps skin [END]  [BEGIN] nothing is true all is permitted so said i to myself [END]  [BEGIN] into the coldest water did i plunge with head and heart [END]  [BEGIN] ah how oft did i stand there naked on that account like a red crab [END]  [BEGIN] 306 thus spake zarathustra ah where have gone all my goodness and all my shame and all my belief in the good [END]  [BEGIN] ah where is the lying innocence which i once possessed the innocence of the good and of their noble lies [END]  [BEGIN] too oft verily did i follow close to the heels of truth then did it kick me on the face [END]  [BEGIN] sometimes i meant to lie and be hold [END]  [BEGIN] then only did i hit the truth [END]  [BEGIN] too much hath become clear unto me now it doth not con cern me any more [END]  [BEGIN] nothing

this seeking for my home o zarathustra dost thou know that this seeking hath been my homesickening it eateth me up [END]  [BEGIN] where is my home [END]  [BEGIN] for it do i ask and seek and have sought but have not found it [END]  [BEGIN] o eternal everywhere o eternal nowhere o eternal invain [END]  [BEGIN] thus spake the shadow and zarathustra s countenance lengthened at his words [END]  [BEGIN] thou art my shadow [END]  [BEGIN] said he at last sadly [END]  [BEGIN] thy danger is not small thou free spirit and wanderer [END]  [BEGIN] thou hast had a bad day see that a still worse evening doth not overtake thee [END]  [BEGIN] to such unsettled ones as thou seemeth at last even a noontide 307 prisoner blessed [END]  [BEGIN] didst thou ever see how captured criminals sleep [END]  [BEGIN] they sleep quietly they enjoy their new security [END]  [BEGIN] beware lest in the end a narrow faith capture thee a hard rigorous delusion [END]  [BEGIN] for now everything that is narrow and fixed seduceth and tempteth thee [END]  [BEGIN] thou hast lost thy goal [END]  [BEGIN] alas how wilt thou forego and forget that loss [END]  [BEGIN] thereby hast thou also lost thy way [END]  [BEGIN] thou poor rover and rambler thou tired butterfly [END]  [BEGIN] wilt thou have a rest and a home this evening [END]  [BEGIN] then go up to my cave [END]  [BEGIN] thither leadeth the way to my cave [END]  [BEGIN] and now will i run quickly away from thee again [END]  [BEGIN] already lieth as it were a shadow upon me [END]  [BEGIN] i will run alone so that it may again become bright around me [END]  [BEGIN] therefore must i still be a long time merrily upon my legs [END]  [BEGIN] in the evening however there will be dancing with me [END]  [BEGIN] thus spake zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN]  [END]  [BEGIN] noontide and zarathustra ran and ran but he found no one else and was alone and ever found himself again he enjoyed and quaffed his solitude and thought of good things for hours [END]  [BEGIN] about the hour of noontide however when the sun stood exactly over zarathustra s head he passed an old bent and gnarled tree which was encircled round by the ardent love of a vine and hidden from itself from this there hung yellow 308 thus spake zarathustra grapes in abundance confronting the wanderer [END]  [BEGIN] then he felt inclined to quench a little thirst and to break off for himself a cluster of grapes [END]  [BEGIN] when however he had already his arm out stretched for that purpose he felt still more inclined for some thing else namely to lie down beside the tree at the hour of perfect noontide and sleep [END]  [BEGIN] this zarathustra did and no sooner had he laid himself on the ground in the stillness and secrecy of the variegated grass than he had forgotten his little thirst and fell asleep [END]  [BEGIN] for as the proverb of zarathustra saith one thing is more neces sary than the other [END]  [BEGIN] only that his eyes remained open for they never grew weary of viewing and admiring the tree and the love of the vine [END]  [BEGIN] in falling asleep however zarathustra spake thus to his heart hush [END]  [BEGIN] hush [END]  [BEGIN] hath not the world now become perfect [END]  [BEGIN] what hath happened unto me [END]  [BEGIN] as a delicate wind danceth invisibly upon parqueted seas light featherlight so danceth sleep upon me [END]  [BEGIN] no eye doth it close to me it leaveth my soul awake [END]  [BEGIN] light is it verily featherlight [END]  [BEGIN] it persuadeth me i know not how it toucheth me inwardly with a caressing hand it constraineth me [END]  [BEGIN] yea it constraineth me so that my soul stretcheth itself out how long and weary it becometh my strange soul [END]  [BEGIN] hath a seventhday evening come to it precisely at noontide [END]  [BEGIN] hath it already wandered too long blissfully among good and ripe things [END]  [BEGIN] it stretcheth itself out long longer [END]  [BEGIN] it lieth still my strange joul too many good things hath it already tasted this golden sadness oppresseth it it distorteth its mouth [END]  [BEGIN] as a ship that putteth into the calmest cove it now noontide 309 draweth up to the land weary of long voyages and uncertain seas [END]  [BEGIN] is not the land more faithful 5 as such a ship huggeth the shore tuggeth the shore then it sufficeth for a spider to spin its thread from the ship to the land [END]  [BEGIN] no stronger ropes are required there [END]  [BEGIN] as such a weary ship in the calmest cove so do i also now repose nigh to the earth faithful trusting waiting bound to it with the lightest threads [END]  [BEGIN] o happiness [END]  [BEGIN] o happiness [END]  [BEGIN] wilt thou perhaps sing o my soul [END]  [BEGIN] thou liest in the grass [END]  [BEGIN] but this is the secret solemn hour when no shepherd playeth his pipe [END]  [BEGIN] take care [END]  [BEGIN] hot noontide sleepeth on the fields [END]  [BEGIN] do not sing [END]  [BEGIN] hush [END]  [BEGIN] the world is perfect [END]  [BEGIN] do not sing thou prairiebird my soul [END]  [BEGIN] do not even whis per [END]  [BEGIN] lo hush [END]  [BEGIN] the old noontide sleepeth it moveth its mouth doth it not just now

whither doth it fly [END]  [BEGIN] let me run after it [END]  [BEGIN] quick [END]  [BEGIN] hush and here zarathustra stretched himself and felt that he was asleep [END]  [BEGIN] up [END]  [BEGIN] said he to himself thou sleeper [END]  [BEGIN] thou noontide sleeper [END]  [BEGIN] well then up ye old legs [END]  [BEGIN] it is time and more than time many a good stretch of road is still awaiting you

[END]  [BEGIN] but then did he fall asleep anew and his soul spake against him and defended itself and lay down again leave me alone [END]  [BEGIN] hush [END]  [BEGIN] hath not the world just now become perfect [END]  [BEGIN] oh for the golden round ball [END]  [BEGIN] get up said zarathustra thou little thief thou slug gard [END]  [BEGIN] what [END]  [BEGIN] still stretching thyself yawning sighing falling into deep wells [END]  [BEGIN] who art thou then o my soul [END]  [BEGIN] and here he became fright ened for a sunbeam shot down from heaven upon his face [END]  [BEGIN] o heaven above me said he sighing and sat upright thou gazest at me [END]  [BEGIN] thou hearkenest unto my strange soul [END]  [BEGIN] when wilt thou drink this drop of dew that fell down upon all earthly things when wilt thou drink this strange soul when thou well of eternity [END]  [BEGIN] thou joyous awful noon tide abyss [END]  [BEGIN] when wilt thou drink my soul back into thee [END]  [BEGIN] thus spake zarathustra and rose from his couch beside the tree as if awakening from a strange drunkenness and behold there stood the sun still exactly above his head [END]  [BEGIN] one might however rightly infer therefrom that zarathustra had not then slept long [END]  [BEGIN] the greeting 31 the greeting it was fate in the afternoon only when zarathustra after long useless searching and strolling about again came home to his cave [END]  [BEGIN] when however he stood over against it not more than twenty paces therefrom the thing happened which he now least of all expected he heard anew the great cry of distress [END]  [BEGIN] and extraordinary [END]  [BEGIN] this time the cry came out of his own cave [END]  [BEGIN] it was a long manifold peculiar cry and zarathustra plainly distinguished that it was composed of many voices although heard at a distance it might sound like the cry out of a single mouth [END]  [BEGIN] thereupon zarathustra rushed forward to his cave an 1 behold [END]  [BEGIN] what a spectacle awaited him after that concert [END]  [BEGIN] for there did they all sit together whom he had passed during the day the king on the right and the king on the left the old magician the pope the voluntary beggar the shadow the in tellectually conscientious one the sorrowful soothsayer and the ass the ugliest man however had set a crown on his head and had put round him two purple girdles for he liked like all ugly ones to disguise himself and play the handsome per son [END]  [BEGIN] in the midst however of that sorrowful company stood zarathustra s eagle ruffled and disquieted for it had been called upon to answer too much for which its pride had not any answer the wise serpent however hung round its neck [END]  [BEGIN] all this did zarathustra behold with great astonishment then however he scrutinised each individual guest with cour teous curiosity read their souls and wondered anew [END]  [BEGIN] in the meantime the assembled ones had risen from their seats and waited with reverence for zarathustra to speak [END]  [BEGIN] zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] however spake thus 32 thtg spake zarathustra ye despairing ones [END]  [BEGIN] ye strange ones [END]  [BEGIN] so it was your cry uf distress that i heard [END]  [BEGIN] and now do i know also where he is to be sought whom i have sought for in vain today the higher man in mine own cave sitteth he the higher man 1 but why do j wonder [END]  [BEGIN] have not i myself allured him to me by honey offerings and artful lurecalls of my happiness [END]  [BEGIN] but it seemeth to me that ye are badly adapted for com pany ye make one another s hearts fretful ye that cry for help when ye sit here together [END]  [BEGIN] there is one that must first come one who will make you laugh once more a good jovial buffoon a dancer a wind a wild romp some old fool what think ye [END]  [BEGIN] forgive me however ye despairing ones for speaking such trivial words before you unworthy verily of such guests [END]  [BEGIN] but ye do not divine what maketh my heart wanton ye yourselves do it and your aspect forgive it me [END]  [BEGIN] for every one becometh courageous who beholdeth a despairing one [END]  [BEGIN] to encourage a despairing one every one thinketh him self strong enough to do so [END]  [BEGIN] to myself have ye given this power a good gift mine honourable guests [END]  [BEGIN] an excellent guest spresent [END]  [BEGIN] well do not then upbraid when i also offer you something of mine [END]  [BEGIN] this is mine empire and my dominion that which is mine however shall this evening and tonight be yours [END]  [BEGIN] mine ani mals shall serve you let my cave be your restingplace [END]  [BEGIN] at house and home with me shall no one despair in my purlieus do i protect every one from his wild beasts [END]  [BEGIN] and that is the first thing which i offer you security [END]  [BEGIN] the second thing however is my little finger [END]  [BEGIN] and when ye the greeting 313 have that then take the whole hand also yea and the heart with it [END]  [BEGIN] welcome here welcome to you my guests [END]  [BEGIN] thus spake zarathustra and laughed with love and mis chief [END]  [BEGIN] after this greeting his guests bowed once more and were reverentially silent the king on the right however answered him in their name [END]  [BEGIN] o zarathustra by the way in which thou hast given us thy hand and thy greeting we recognise thee as zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] thou hast humbled thyself before us almost hast thou hurt our reverence who however could have humbled himself as thou hast done with such pride [END]  [BEGIN] that uplifteth us ourselves a refresh ment is it to our eyes and hearts [END]  [BEGIN] to behold this merely gladly would we ascend higher mountains than this [END]  [BEGIN] for as eager beholders have we come we wanted to see what brighteneth dim eyes [END]  [BEGIN] and lo [END]  [BEGIN] now is it all over with our cries of distress [END]  [BEGIN] now are our minds and hearts open and enraptured [END]  [BEGIN] little is lack ing for our spirits to become wanton [END]  [BEGIN] there is nothing o zarathustra that groweth more pleas ingly on earth than a lofty strong will it is the finest growth [END]  [BEGIN] an entire landscape refresheth itself at one such tree [END]  [BEGIN] to the pine do i compare him o zarathustra which groweth up like thee tall silent hardy solitary of the best supplest wood stately in the end however grasping out for its dominion with strong green branches asking weighty questions of the wind the storm and whatever is at home on high places answering more weightily a commander a victor [END]  [BEGIN] oh [END]  [BEGIN] who should not ascend high mountains to behold such growths [END]  [BEGIN] at thy tree o zarathustra the gloomy and illconstituted thus spake zarathustra also refresh themselves at thy look even the wavering becomx steady and heal their hearts [END]  [BEGIN] and verily towards thy mountain and thy tree do many eyes turn today a great longing hath arisen and many have learned to ask who is zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] and those into whose ears thou hast at any time dripped thy song and thy honey all the hidden ones the lonedwellers and the twaindwellers have simultaneously said to their hearts doth zarathustra still live [END]  [BEGIN] it is no longer worth while to live everything is indifferent everything is useless or else we must live with zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] why doth he not come who hath so long announced him self [END]  [BEGIN] thus do many people ask hath solitude swallowed him up [END]  [BEGIN] or should we perhaps go to him [END]  [BEGIN] now doth it come to pass that solitude itself becometh fragile and breaketh open like a grave that breaketh open and can no longer hold its dead [END]  [BEGIN] everywhere one seeth resurrected ones [END]  [BEGIN] now do the waves rise and rise around thy mountain o zarathustra [END]  [BEGIN] and however high be thy height many of them must rise up to thee thy boat shall not rest much longer on dry ground [END]  [BEGIN] and that we despairing ones have now come into thy cave and already no longer despair it is but a prognostic and a presage that better ones are on the way to thee for they themselves are on the way to thee the last remnant of god among men that is to say all the men of great longing of great loathing of great satiety all who do not want to live unless they learn again to hope unless they learn from thee [END]  [BEGIN] o zarathustra the great hope [END]  [BEGIN] the greeting 315 thus spake the king on the right and seized the hand of zarathustra in order to kiss it but zarathustra checked his veneration and stepped back frightened fleeing as it were silently and suddenly into the far distance [END]  [BEGIN] after a little while however he was again at home with his guests looked at them with clear scrutinising eyes and said my guests ye higher men i will speak plain language and plainly with you [END]  [BEGIN] it is not for you that i have waited here in these mountains [END]  [BEGIN] plain language and plainly [END]  [BEGIN] good god [END]  [BEGIN] said here the king on the left to himself one seeth he doth not know the good occidentals this sage out of the orient [END]  [BEGIN] but he meaneth blunt language and bluntly well [END]  [BEGIN] that is not the worst taste in these days [END]  [BEGIN] ye may verily all of you be higher men continued zara thustra but for me ye are neither high enough nor strong enough [END]  [BEGIN] for me that is to say for the inexorable whch is now silent in me but will not always be silent [END]  [BEGIN] and if ye appertain to me still it is not as my right arm [END]  [BEGIN] for he who himself standeth

ye dissemble and disguise yourselves before me [END]  [BEGIN] how the hearts of all of you convulsed with delight and wickedness because ye had at last become again like little children namely pious

stood still beside one another all of them old people but with comforted brave hearts and astonished in themselves that it was so well with them on earth the mystery of the night however came nighcr

happiness and their silence [END]  [BEGIN] then however there happened that which in this astonish ing long day was most astonishing the ugliest man began once more and for the last time to gurgle and

birds the whizzing of so many wings however and the crowding around his head was so great that he shut his eyes [END]  [BEGIN] and verily there came down upon him as it were a cloud like a cloud of arrows which poureth upon a new enemy [END]  [BEGIN] but behold here it was a cloud of love and showered upon a new friend [END]  [BEGIN] what happeneth unto me [END]  [BEGIN] thought zarathustra in his astonished heart and slowly seated himself on the big stone which lay close to the exit from his cave [END]  [BEGIN] but while he grasped about with his hands around him above him and below him

before him a roar a long soft lionroar [END]  [BEGIN] the sign cometh said zarathustra and a change came the sign 367 over nis heart [END]  [BEGIN] and in truth when it turned clear before him there lay a yellow powerful animal at his feet resting its head on his knee unwilling to leave him out of love and doing like a dog which again findeth its old master [END]  [BEGIN] the doves how ever were

further notice of anything but sat there motionless without repelling the animals further [END]  [BEGIN] then flew the doves to and fro and perched on his shoulder and caressed his white hair and did not tire of their tenderness and joyousness [END]  [BEGIN] the strong lion however licked always the tears that fell on zarathustra s hands and roared and growled shyly [END]  [BEGIN] thus did these animals do [END]  [BEGIN] all this went on for a long time or a short time for properly speaking there is no time on earth for such things [END]  [BEGIN] mean while however the higher men had awakened in zarathustra s cave and marshalled themselves for a procession to go to meet zarathustra and give him their morning greeting for they had found when they awakened that he no longer tarried with them [END]  [BEGIN] when however they reached the door of the cave and the noise of their steps had preceded them the hon started violently it turned away all at once from zarathustra and roaring wildly sprang towards the cave [END]  [BEGIN] the higher men however when they heard the lion roaring cried all aloud as with one voice fled back and vanished in an instant [END]  [BEGIN] zarathustra himself however stunned and strange ros from his seat looked around him stood there astonished in 368 thus spake zarathustra quired of his heart bethought himself and remained alone [END]  [BEGIN] what did i hear [END]  [BEGIN] said he at last slowly what happened unto me just now [END]  [BEGIN] but soon there came to him his recollection and he took in at a glance all that had taken place between yesterday and to day [END]  [BEGIN] here is indeed the stone said he and stroked his beard on sat i yestermorn and here came the soothsayer unto me [END]  [BEGIN] and here heard i first the cry which

zarathustra said he to me i come to seduce thee to thy last sin to my last sin [END]  [BEGIN] cried zarathustra and laughed angrily at his own words what hath been reserved for me as my last sin [END]  [BEGIN] and once more zarathustra became absorbed in himself and sat down again on the big stone and meditated [END]  [BEGIN] suddenly he sprang up fellowsuffering [END]  [BEGIN] fellowsuffering with the higher men [END]  [BEGIN] he cried out arid his countenance changed into brass [END]  [BEGIN] well [END]  [BEGIN] 1 that hath had its time [END]  [BEGIN] my suffering and my fellowsuffering what
