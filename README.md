# Virtual_Nietzsche

This Virtual Nietzsche is a predictive sentence generator in the style of Friedrich Nietzsche. We have built it from scratch in order to better understand n-grams. 

In addition, a classifier is also trained to identify from which of the five books the line is most likely to be found in.

## Dataset

We have used a dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/hsankesara/books-of-friedrich-nietzsche).
